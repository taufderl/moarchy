// The app drawer: what the bottom-edge swipe up opens.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why not just keep opening the Omarchy menu
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The swipe used to run `omarchy-menu toggle apps`, which is the desktop
// command palette opened at its Apps page: a single-column list of names, no
// icons, built to be filtered by typing. That is the right shape for a keyboard
// and the wrong one for a thumb -- on a phone the launcher is the primary way
// in, and it should be an icon grid you recognise rather than a list you read.
//
// The palette is not lost. Everything it could reach lives in
// moarchy.settings, behind the control center's gear -- which is where system
// administration belongs on a phone, rather than one mis-tap from an app icon
// on the launcher. $mod+Alt+Space still opens the menu at its root for anyone
// with a keyboard attached.
//
// So at rest this screen is a search field and a grid, and nothing else. On a
// screen that fits four icons across, a row of controls at the top is a row of
// apps you cannot see.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why typing brings settings back
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// At rest, and only at rest. Browsing wants the grid; already knowing the name
// of the thing wants a field, and it is the same field either way. So once
// there is a query, matching Settings rows appear beneath the apps
// (docs/settings.md section O): Screenshot runs, Set a reminder opens its
// screen, Night light opens the page it lives on.
//
// This is not the palette coming back and it is not a second copy of the tree.
// The index is a walk of moarchy.settings' own PAGES, the tap goes through
// moarchy.settings' own activate(), and there is no list of actions here to
// fall out of date. What the app drawer owns is the field and the rows it draws.
//
// The two imports below are the price: this plugin will not load without
// moarchy.settings beside it. They ship in one package to one directory, so
// that holds -- but a `~/.config/omarchy/plugins` copy of only *one* of the two
// breaks the path, and the user directory wins. Clear both or neither.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why this owns no edge of its own
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// moarchy.gestures already owns the bottom strip, and two exclusive
// layer surfaces cannot share an edge -- the second one is arranged above the
// first rather than on top of it. So the gesture plugin keeps the input and
// toggles this plugin through the shell. The app drawer itself is only ever a
// destination.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why Top + a zero exclusive zone rather than Overlay
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The search field needs the on-screen keyboard, and moarchy-keyboard sits on Top
// with an exclusive zone. A surface that reserves nothing is arranged into
// whatever area is left after the exclusive ones are placed -- so on Top with
// zone 0 the app drawer is laid out below the bar, above the home pill, and above
// the keyboard when it rises, without a single line of geometry maths here.
// Overlay would put it over all three and leave the grid buried under the
// keyboard, which is the one arrangement that makes search useless.

    // Measured, not reasoned about: unconditional, with the keyboard up, the
    // app drawer's last 20px covered the whole top key row -- `qwertyuiop` reduced
    // to a sliver under the app labels. Content compensation does not help,
    // because the grid's bottomMargin moves the last *row* and not the surface.

    // stand-in stopped standing for anything: left in, it dropped the inset on
    // every tap in the search box with no keyboard underneath, and a band of
