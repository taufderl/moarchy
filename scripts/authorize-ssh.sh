# Authorise a GitHub account's public SSH keys on this phone. RUNS ON THE PHONE.
#
#   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonSchubert/moarchy/main/scripts/authorize-ssh.sh | sh -s <github-user>
#
# Why this exists: a reflash wipes /home/moarchy/.ssh, and sshd runs with
# PasswordAuthentication off (the account's only password is the public
# default lock-screen PIN, D30), so publickey is the only thing that can work. So the way back in is
# either a reflash (which means the phone in fastboot and a cable) or one line
# typed on the phone itself. This is that line.
#
# The username is required and has NO default. This file lives in a public repo:
# a default would mean every person who pastes the line out of the README
# authorises somebody else's key on their own phone. That is the backdoor
# image/configure.sh refuses to bake into a published image, arriving by a
# different road, and it is refused here for the same reason.
#
# Keys come from https://github.com/<user>.keys -- GitHub's own listing of the
# public keys on an account. Nothing secret crosses the wire, and this repo
# carries no key material of its own to go stale.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: it is fetched and piped, so the shebang above is only
# honoured when the file is run directly, and `| sh` has to be the truth.
