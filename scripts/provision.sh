#   PHONE       ssh target                (default moarchy@192.168.0.18, over wifi)
#   WIFI_SSID   preseed this wifi network into the image we build (optional)
#   WIFI_PSK    its password (pass via env, never as an argument)
#
# Wifi is the only way in. Preseeding saves one round trip with a USB keyboard
# and `nmtui`; it is not otherwise required.
