# Build log

How this went from a blank SD card to Omarchy running on a PinePhone, including
the parts that failed. Written after the fact but from real command output —
where a number appears, it was measured on the device.

Host: macOS on Apple Silicon. Target: **Pine64 PinePhone Braveheart (1.1)** —
Allwinner A64, 4× Cortex-A53 @ 1.15 GHz, 2 GB RAM, 720×1440.

## 0. The two findings that determined everything

Both were checked before any code was written, and both are the reason this is a
port rather than an install.

**Hyprland cannot run on this device.** Its renderer includes `<GLES3/gl32.h>`
and aborts without a GLES 3.x context:

```
src/render/OpenGL.cpp:  RASSERT(false, "EGL: failed to create a context with either GLES3.2 or 3.0")
```

Measured on the phone afterwards:

```
OpenGL ES profile renderer: Mali400
OpenGL ES profile version:  OpenGL ES 2.0 Mesa 26.2.1
```

GLES **2.0**. Hyprland 0.50 also removed the legacy GLES2 renderer, so there is
no version that works. The compositor had to be **Sway** (wlroots, GLES2).

**Omarchy's package repo has no usable aarch64 base:**

```
https://pkgs.omarchy.org/stable/x86_64/omarchy.db  -> 200
https://pkgs.omarchy.org/stable/aarch64/omarchy.db -> 200  (app catalog, no omarchy base package)
```

The aarch64 tree appeared later but is an app catalog with no `omarchy`
metapackage or `omarchy-config`. Its installer also requires limine, btrfs and Snapper. So none of upstream's
installer is used — only its architecture-neutral config/theme layer, vendored.

## 1. Base OS

DanctNIX Arch Linux ARM (`archlinux-pinephone-barebone-20251224.img.xz`) flashed
to SD, then a full upgrade: **175 packages, `linux-megi` 6.15.6 → 6.18.39**,
rebooted cleanly in ~20 s.

Two traps on the way:

- **`dd: Permission denied`, even with sudo.** Not permissions — the SD adapter's
  physical write-protect switch. `diskutil` reports `Media Read-Only: Yes` and the
  device node is mode `r--r-----`, so even root is refused. `scripts/flash-sd.sh`
  now checks this up front instead of failing after a password prompt.
- **macOS `sudo` needs a tty**, and a `read` prompt under `set -e` dies *silently*
  on EOF — indistinguishable from a flash that did nothing.

## 2. Getting a shell: USB does not work from a Mac

DanctNIX's USB gadget presents **RNDIS**, and macOS ships no RNDIS driver. The
phone enumerates (`ioreg` shows `DanctNIX / "Arch Linux Mobile"`) but no network
interface ever appears. The descriptor says it plainly:

```
UsbDeviceSignature = <... 02 02 ff ...>     02/02/ff = RNDIS
                                            02/06/00 would be CDC-ECM
```

`scripts/patch-image.sh` rewrites the gadget to CDC-ECM before flashing, editing
the image's ext4 rootfs with `debugfs` — no VM, no root, no loop mounts. It
verifies `usb_f_ecm` is in the kernel's `modules.builtin` first.

That got macOS to bind `en9` and dmesg to show a matching `HOST MAC` — but the
gadget side stays `NO-CARRIER`, because macOS never selects alt-setting 1 on the
ECM data interface. **Wifi is the working transport.** The same script can
preseed a NetworkManager profile, which is what actually got us in.

## 3. Packages

Most of the stack exists for aarch64. What does not:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Built from source on the Mac | `walker`, `elephant`, `yay`, `xdg-terminal-exec`, `ttf-ia-writer` |
| Dropped, x86-only | 1Password, Spotify, Obsidian, Typora, dotnet |
| Dropped, no aarch64 build | `tesseract` (OCR capture) |

Docker Desktop runs `linux/arm64` natively on Apple Silicon, so these build in
minutes rather than at A53 speed. Two non-obvious requirements, both now in
`docker/Dockerfile.builder`:

- Docker Desktop's VM kernel has **no Landlock**, which pacman 7 uses to sandbox
  downloads — every `pacman -Sy` fails with `switching to sandbox user 'alpm'
  failed`. Needs `DisableSandbox`, **inserted under `[options]`**; appending puts
  it in the trailing `[aur]` section where pacman silently ignores it.
- Arch Linux ARM's `makepkg.conf` does not use `PKGEXT=.pkg.tar.zst` — output is
  `.pkg.tar.xz`. Set `PKGDEST`; never glob for an extension.

## 4. The port itself

The load-bearing discovery: Omarchy generates all per-app theming from one
`colors.toml` per theme, and `omarchy-theme-set-templates` **already reads a user
template directory** (`~/.config/omarchy/themed`) ahead of its built-ins. So
adding a single `sway.conf.tpl` themes Sway from every theme **without patching
the vendored upstream at all**.

The rest was mechanical: ~100 keybindings translated key-for-key, and Sway
counterparts for Omarchy's Hyprland helpers. One shim turned out to be
load-bearing — **`uwsm-app`**, which 16 vendored scripts invoke; without it
`SUPER+SPACE`, the editor and background switching all silently did nothing.

Result: `sway -C` passes, **19/19 themes generate valid Sway config**, session
autologins on tty1.

## 5. Omarchy 4.x

An earlier version of this document claimed 4.x was unreachable because it "moved
to herdr, an x86-only shell". **That was wrong twice over**: herdr is a Rust
terminal workspace manager, not the shell, and it is Apache-2.0 with public
source.

4.x's shell is **95 QML files in Omarchy's own repo**, rendered by
**quickshell** — which is packaged for aarch64 and *does* render on a Mali-400.
`Quickshell.I3` mirrors the Hyprland singleton for everything the shell uses, so
the translation is mechanical (`install/port-4x.sh`):

| 4.x uses | Sway equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `import Quickshell.Hyprland` | `import Quickshell.I3` (5 files) |
| `HyprlandEvent` | `I3Event` |
| `target: Hyprland` | `target: I3` — a *bare* singleton reference a dot-anchored regex misses |
| `.workspaces`, `.focusedWorkspace`, `.focusedMonitor`, `onRawEvent` | identical names |
| `HyprlandFocusGrab` | **no counterpart** — neutralised, so popups lose click-outside-dismiss |

Plus: **`SWAYSOCK` must be exported** or the bar draws but never populates, and
the shell shells out to `hyprctl` for two layout metrics, needing a shim.

Three further bugs a bare import swap does not catch, all in the workspaces
widget:

- `occupied` read `workspace.toplevels` — Hyprland-only. Sway carries the same
  information in the IPC object's `representation`.
- `focusWorkspace` dispatched through `hyprctl`, so **tapping a workspace did
  nothing**.
- **Hyprland's workspace `.id` *is* the visible number; sway's `.id` is an
  internal handle** and the number lives in `.number`. Comparing `.id` against
  1/2/3 meant the focused workspace never matched, and the internal id leaked in
  as a phantom entry.

Omarchy's own `omarchy-update` can never work here: 4.x ships Omarchy as a
package from the x86_64-only repo, and the updater wants Snapper/btrfs.

## 6. Phone-shaped tuning

Measured, not guessed:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Panel | 720×1440, `scale 2` → **360×720 logical** |
| Terminal | **47×41 characters** at font size 9 |
| btop minimum | **60 columns**, regardless of `shown_boxes` |

Hence `moarchy-launch-tui` runs TUIs at font size 7. `btm` (bottom) is the
system monitor that *does* fit at the default font size.

TUIs were fullscreened too, until 2026-09-06; see §6m.

The bar is centre-anchored on the clock, so the clock's width decides where every
module sits. Upstream's `dddd HH:mm` changes width with the day name and shifted
the whole bar; `HH:mm` is fixed width. `omarchy.indicators` and
`omarchy.system-update` were dropped for the same reason — they appear and vanish.

Two things worth knowing about this hardware:

- **Never `pkill swaylock`.** Under `ext-session-lock` the compositor stays locked
  with no client to authenticate against, and sway paints a solid red screen.
  Recover by restarting sway.
- **No idle lock.** A layer-shell keyboard cannot draw over an `ext-session-lock`
  surface, so an idle lock leaves a touch-only device unrecoverable.

## 6b. The phone shell: bar, drawer, shade, settings, themes

Five Quickshell plugins in `default/omarchy/plugins/`, alongside the gesture
strip that was already there, and no patches to the vendored shell. The plugin
contract already covered every shape they needed.

The shape the UI settled into: **the drawer launches things, the shade changes
them.** Everything the Omarchy menu reaches that is not an app -- Setup,
Install, Remove, Update, Keybindings, About, System -- lives in a settings list
behind the shade's gear, and the drawer is a search field and a grid of apps
and nothing else. An early version put four of those routes across the top of
the drawer; on a screen that fits four icons across, a row of controls is a row
of apps you cannot see, and it put `Remove` one mis-tap from launching
something.

**Bar replacement is a first-class operation.** `shell.qml` reads
`shell.json`'s `bar.id`, loads that plugin's `bar` entry point, and deactivates
`omarchy.bar`. On a load error it logs one `console.warn` and silently falls
back. Measured: RSS drops from **414 MB to 361 MB** when the desktop bar's
thirteen widgets — four of them large popup panels — stop being instantiated.

**The two plugin kinds are enabled by different keys**, and crossing them is a
silent no-op. `PluginRegistry.isEnabled()` short-circuits for a `kind: "bar"`
plugin and answers purely from `bar.id`; everything else falls through to
`findEntryLocation()`, which only finds `{"id": ...}` entries in `plugins[]`.
A bar listed in `plugins[]` is inert; an overlay set as `bar.id` is invisible.

**Layer arrangement, measured rather than assumed.** Sway places
exclusive-zone surfaces first, top layer down, then arranges everything else
into what is left. So:

| Surface | Layer | Zone | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bar | Top | Auto (26px) | reserves the top |
| gestures strip | Overlay | Auto (20px) | keeps the bottom edge above squeekboard |
| drawer | Top | **Normal, 0** | arranged *into* the usable area — below the bar, above the home pill, and **above squeekboard when it rises**, with no geometry maths |
| shade | Overlay | Ignore | covers everything, which is what a pull-down is |

The drawer's zero exclusive zone is the whole reason its search field works:
focus it and the grid re-flows above the keyboard instead of being buried by
it. Confirmed with `swaymsg -t get_workspaces` — the focused workspace stays
`y=29 h=668` whether the drawer or the shade is open, so neither reserves
anything.

**The shade grows its surface rather than being permanently full-screen.** The
usual drag-to-reveal is an always-mapped full-screen surface masked down to a
strip, which leaves a 720x1440 blend in every frame forever on a Mali-400.
Instead the surface anchors top/left/right only, so `implicitHeight` owns its
size: 26px until a finger moves, then one resize to full screen, then the drag
is a child item's `y`. Wayland's implicit grab is per-surface, not
per-geometry, so the in-flight touch survives the resize.

**Why the phone bar has no tap targets.** The shade's grab strip is on Overlay
and covers the bar's top 26px, so a button on that bar would never receive a
touch and the cause would not be anywhere near it. This is forced by the
layering, not a style choice.

**Three traps, each of which fails silently:**

- A host-injected property must not be `readonly` *or* `required`. Readonly
  makes the assignment throw; required makes the component fail to instantiate,
  because a plugin is created by a `Loader` and configured afterwards in
  `onLoaded`. The first-party `omarchy.bar` can use `required` only because the
  host constructs it inline.
- `\uXXXX` in QML takes **exactly four** hex digits. Writing the wifi glyph
  as `"8"` yields U+F092 followed by a literal `8`, and `"\U000F0928"`
  -- a form JavaScript does not have -- yields a literal `U`. Every Nerd Font
  MDI glyph is above the BMP, so they go into the source as literal
  characters, the way the vendored shell's own `Model.js` does it. The
  symptom is one wrong glyph on screen and nothing in the log.
- **A property named `on<Uppercase>` is never readable.** QML reserves that
  prefix for signal handlers, so `readonly property color onSurface: ...`
  declares something that cannot be read back: the binding evaluates to
  undefined, undefined assigned to a `color` is `#000000`, and **nothing is
  logged**. Written the Material way -- `onSurface`, `onAccent` -- every glyph
  and label bound to them painted pure black on a dark tile, while `container`
  and `subdued` two lines above worked fine. Sampling the pixels is what found
  it: the glyphs were `(0,0,0)` exactly, not the theme's near-black background,
  and a colour that is *exactly* zero is a value nobody chose. They are
  `textOnSurface` / `textOnAccent` now.
- Closing a surface is not a text-input deactivate. Dismiss the drawer straight
  from its search field and squeekboard stays up over whatever is underneath.
  `focus = false` is not enough — that releases the focus *scope*. Handing
  active focus to a plain sink `Item` is what makes Qt send the disable.

**The theme picker was almost free.** `omarchy-theme-set` already ends by
calling `omarchy-shell shell applyTheme` with the new palette, and the shell's
`Color` singleton reloads in place — so the bar, drawer, shade and the picker
itself recolour live, with the picker doing nothing about it. What it does have
to handle is that regenerating every app's template takes **~7 s** on an A53:
the tapped card stays lit while the rest of the grid dims, and a second tap is
refused rather than queued behind `omarchy-theme-set`'s lock.

Each card is painted in the theme it names, from that theme's `colors.toml`.
Not from the `preview.png` every theme ships: those are 1800x1012 desktop
screenshots at ~440 KB, and twenty-two of them decoded at once is more than
this phone has spare — quite apart from being illegible at 166px wide. Two
things about the current theme are easy to get wrong: `current/theme` is a
staged **copy**, not a symlink, so its basename is always the literal string
`theme`; the slug lives in `current/theme.name`. And `omarchy-theme-set` takes
the **display** name, so the slug has to be title-cased exactly the way
`omarchy-theme-list`'s sed does it or the lookup misses.

**The drawer follows the finger, and getting there cost three mechanisms.**
The bottom strip belongs to the gestures plugin -- an edge belongs to one layer
surface -- so the drawer never sees the opening touch. The gestures plugin
resolves the drawer's live instance once per gesture through
`shell.panelLoaders[id].item` and writes its `progress` directly; a
`shell.callIfLoaded` round-trip marshals a string per call and this runs at
touch-event rate. Measured, an open drag leaves 25-45 samples: a ramp, not a
jump.

Closing needed a different mechanism, and two attempts failed for reasons worth
recording:

- **The gesture strip cannot host it.** It *is* the bottom edge of the screen,
  so a downward drag has about twenty pixels before it runs off the panel --
  the same reason the shade cannot be closed by dragging up from its handle.
- **The grid cannot supply it.** The plan was to let the GridView be dragged
  past its top and follow the overscroll. But with the apps this phone has,
  `contentHeight` measures **516** against a **598** view: a Flickable whose
  content fits does not drag at all, so `contentY` never leaves 0 and there is
  nothing to follow. It worked once by accident and never again.
- **A `DragHandler` over the sheet cannot either.** It delivers **one**
  translation event for an entire gesture here, because the app delegates'
  `MouseArea`s hold the exclusive grab and the handler only ever gets a passive
  one. It also has to be spelled `onTranslationChanged`: `activeTranslation`
  and `persistentTranslation` share a single NOTIFY signal, and QML names the
  handler after the signal, so `onActiveTranslationChanged` silently never
  runs -- the handler activates, the sheet does not move, nothing is logged.

What works is the mechanism the rest of this UI already uses: a
`MultiPointTouchArea` on a strip of its own -- a handle bar across the top of
the sheet. The surface it covers is its input region, the implicit grab keeps
the whole gesture on it, and it cannot compete with a tap on an app icon
because it does not overlap one.

**Changing `keyboard_interactivity` mid-gesture cancels the touch.** The
drawer's `keyboardFocus` was gated on `opened`, which is
`progress >= 1 && !dragging` -- so it went false on the *first frame* of the
close drag. That drops the layer surface to `None`, sway hands keyboard focus
back to a window, and the focus change cancels the touch the surface is still
holding. The drag died after one frame.

The tell was that it only failed **when a window was open for focus to return
to**: by hand on an empty workspace it worked every time, and under the
selftest -- which spawns two scratch windows first -- it failed every time.
Two environments, opposite results, same code. What made it diagnosable was a
`-1` pushed into the drag trace from `onCanceled`: a cancel and a drag that
simply did not travel far enough both leave the drawer open, and they want
opposite fixes. `trace=[99 -1]` said which in one reading.

Gating on `progress > 0` instead holds Exclusive until the sheet is all the way
down. Measured with a window present: 48-53 samples opening, 51-52 closing,
three runs out of three.

**That drag has to be 1:1, and that is not a preference.** The handle is *on*
the sheet it moves. At a third of the sheet height it moved ~3.7x finger speed,
the touch ended up above the strip it started on, and the gesture came back as
a cancel often enough to leave the drawer open on a full drag. Matching the
travel to the sheet height keeps the bar under the thumb. The opening drag can
use a shorter travel precisely because it is driven from a strip that does not
move.

**A test that cannot fail is not a test.** The first version of the selftest's
icon check asked fontconfig whether anything covered each glyph's codepoint.
It passed against a deliberately truncated escape, because Nerd Fonts cover the
low private use area too: `U+F0249` cut to `U+F024` still resolves, and still
draws the wrong glyph with a `9` after it. The check that works tests the
invariant these strings actually have -- **an icon literal is exactly one
character** -- and it was only worth keeping once it had been watched to fail
on an injected truncation and pass again when it was reverted.

**Net memory, all five plugins loaded: 361 MB RSS against a 414 MB baseline**
with the desktop bar, and 1037 MB available. The phone shell is cheaper than
what it replaced, because thirteen desktop widgets — four of them large popup
panels — stop being instantiated.

**Two things needed outside the shell:** `usermod -aG feedbackd` for the torch
(`/sys/class/leds/white:flash/brightness` is `root:feedbackd 0664` and the group
is empty on a bare install — true on the PinePhone that day, and *not* true on
sargo, which is §6v), and a real log destination —
`moarchy-restart-shell` used to send the shell's stdout to `/dev/null`,
which threw away the only diagnosis a failed bar plugin ever produces.

## 6c. The bottom edge: recents, home, drawer

The top edge was finished before the bottom one was. The shade pulls down and
the drawer pulls up, but "pull up" was the only thing an upward swipe could
ever mean: no way to see what was running, no way to reach an app except
swiping sideways through workspaces one at a time, and no way to close one
except a 500 ms hold that killed whatever happened to be focused.

It is the Android arrangement now. One drag from the home pill, three stops:

```
0 ---- 40% -------- 75% ---- 100%   of a 0.45 x screen-height travel
app    RECENTS       HOME
```

**Which two stops you get is decided on press, and that is the whole design.**
An occupied workspace means the swipe is about the apps you already have open,
so it drives the recents carousel and then home. A blank workspace means the
swipe is about starting one, so it drives the drawer, exactly as it did before.
The consequence is that the drawer is one swipe from home and two from an app
-- and that a blank workspace is worth landing on, which is what makes home a
destination rather than a gap between apps.

Occupancy comes from `I3.focusedWorkspace.lastIpcObject.representation` being
non-empty. That test is not new: `install/port-4x.sh` already patches it into
the vendored Workspaces widget, because `I3Workspace` has no `toplevels` model
-- that shape is Hyprland's, and reading it throws. Sway's raw IPC workspace
carries a layout string instead, `V[foot]` or empty, and it is the only
occupancy signal the protocol offers.

**Home is a blank workspace, not a sixth surface.** One app per workspace
already makes an unoccupied workspace the thing a home screen is: wallpaper,
bar, home pill, nothing else. A real home layer would have cost another
always-mapped surface and its bindings, permanently, to draw what was already
there. Picking the target reuses the rule
`bin/moarchy-one-app-per-workspace` uses -- the lowest number with
nothing on it -- so the sideways swipe order stays contiguous. `number` is the
visible workspace number; `id` is an internal Sway handle, and dispatching
against it switches somewhere else, silently.

**Distance decides home; speed is only allowed to rescue a flick.** A fling
past 0.6 logical px/ms can commit the recents band that a short fast swipe
did not quite reach, because that is a gesture people make when they already
know where they are going. It is deliberately *not* allowed to carry the drag
past a stop the finger never reached. Velocity-triggered home would mean a
quick swipe sometimes lands on the carousel and sometimes on the wallpaper
depending on how hard you flicked, and the drawer would become unreachable by
accident.

**`ToplevelManager` is the find, and it is the first thing here that reads
compositor state from QML without forking.** `zwlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v1`,
which Sway implements, hands over `appId`, `title`, which window is active, a
`closed()` signal, and the only two verbs a card needs: `activate()` and
`close()`. Tapping a card is one `activate()` -- Sway focuses the window and
switches to its workspace on its own, so there is no con_id to look up and no
`get_tree` walk. Everything else in this repo that wants compositor state
shells out to `swaymsg`; while `Quickshell.I3` was imported for the occupancy
test anyway, the workspace switches went the same way, which takes a fork off
the most common gesture on the phone.

**Cards are icons, not thumbnails, and there are two independent reasons.**
Quickshell 0.3.1's `ScreencopyView.captureSource` takes a `ShellScreen` --
through `wlr-screencopy`, which is what grim uses -- or a `Toplevel`. The
toplevel path is wired only to `hyprland-toplevel-export-v1`, which Sway does
not implement, so there is no per-window capture to be had at all. And even
given the protocol there would be nothing to capture: Sway does not render a
workspace that is not visible, so the one frame a recents card wants is the one
frame nobody is drawing. Android solves that by snapshotting each app as it is
backgrounded, which here would mean N 720x1440 textures resident inside this
budget on a Mali-400 -- the same cost that stopped the theme picker using each
theme's `preview.png`.

**Three things about the carousel that were wrong in a way nothing reported.**

- **A pitch-wide delegate, not view margins.** The obvious way to centre the
  first and last cards is `leftMargin`/`rightMargin` on the ListView. That
  fights `StrictlyEnforceRange`: the margins and the highlight range each want
  to decide `contentX`, and the view settles with one card filling the screen
  and its neighbours pushed out of sight -- no warning, no binding loop, just a
  carousel that looks like a single card. Making the delegate one *pitch* wide
  -- card plus its gap, with the card centred inside it -- and the highlight
  range the same width gives exactly one position per card, and the next app
  peeks in at the edge again. That peek is the only thing that says the row can
  be paged at all.
- **A correct card can still be invisible.** Painted flat at
  `Color.menu.background` the cards were exactly right and could not be seen:
  the scrim is that same background colour over a dark app, so an unfocused
  card matched its surroundings to the byte. Sampling settled it -- the
  neighbour at (660,700) read `#111c18` and so did the empty space next to it,
  which is not a card that failed to draw, it is a card with nowhere to stand
  out against. Cards are a tinted surface with an edge on every one now, accent
  and heavier on the active one. This is the second time here that reading
  pixels rather than looking at the screenshot is what found the bug.
- **Dismiss is vertical, paging is horizontal, and that is why both work.**
  The delegate's `MouseArea` drags on `Drag.YAxis` with `preventStealing`
  false, so the enclosing Flickable takes a horizontal drag once it passes its
  own threshold and a vertical one stays on the card. The shade rejected
  swipe-to-dismiss for its notifications for the opposite reason: there both
  gestures wanted the same axis as the scroll. A `DragHandler` is still no use
  -- over a sheet of delegates it gets one translation event for a whole
  gesture, because the delegates' MouseAreas hold the exclusive grab.

**The carousel takes the whole output, and the drawer must not.** The drawer
is on Top with a zero exclusive zone, which means it is *arranged into*
whatever the exclusive surfaces left -- and that is the feature: its search
field needs squeekboard, so the grid reflowing above the keyboard is the point.
Copying that for the carousel put it in the top two thirds of the screen
whenever the app behind happened to have a text field focused, with "Clear all"
pushed under the keyboard and untappable. Nothing was wrong in the
arrangement; it was the right arrangement applied to the wrong kind of surface.
`ExclusionMode.Ignore` takes the whole output, the way the shade does, and the
keyboard is simply behind it. It needs none of the shade's mask to keep the
home pill live either: the gesture strip is on Overlay, every Overlay surface
sits above every Top one, and so the pill stays touchable over the carousel
with no geometry at all -- which is what lets one drag carry on past the
recents stop into the home band.

Related, and only visible once the surface was full-height: the scrim has to
reach **fully opaque** at the top of the drag. Half-open, seeing the app
through it is what says the sheet is still moving. Fully open it is a switcher,
and anything showing through is noise -- with a text field focused behind, that
noise is an entire on-screen keyboard ghosting under the cards.

**The carousel never takes keyboard focus, and that is a decision.** The
drawer needs `Exclusive` for its search field and pays for it: gating
`keyboardFocus` on `opened` there dropped interactivity on the first frame of a
close drag, Sway handed focus back to a window, and the focus change cancelled
the touch the surface was still holding. A carousel has no text input, so
`None` sidesteps that whole class of bug rather than working around it. Touch
reaches a layer surface either way.

**Two things that cost an hour and were not the code.**

- **`sudo` resets PATH.** `sudo -n moarchy-touch swipe ...` is
  `command not found`, and with the output redirected it is a swipe that
  silently does not happen. Every band read as "the gesture does nothing"
  while the plugin was never sent a single touch event. The selftest had this
  right all along -- it invokes the injector by absolute path.
- **A blanked screen disables touch.** `moarchy-screen` turns the touch
  input off with the panel, so after an idle timeout synthetic swipes land
  nowhere, `grim` blocks with no frames to capture, and IPC calls time out
  behind a busy compositor. It looks precisely like a deadlocked shell. What
  distinguishes them is that a deadlock does not have a load average of 0.24:
  `swaymsg -t get_outputs` reporting `power: false` is the one-line answer, and
  powering the output back on is not enough -- the input has to be re-enabled
  too, which is why `moarchy-screen on` exists and `swaymsg output * power
  on` is not a substitute.

**`moarchy-restart-shell` needed `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`.** It already derives
`SWAYSOCK` so a restart from an ssh session works; without `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` Qt
falls through to the xcb platform plugin, fails to reach a display, and aborts
before reading a line of QML -- `FATAL: no Qt platform plugin could be
initialized`, which reads like a broken shell rather than a missing variable and
leaves the phone with no bar until someone restarts it from a terminal on the
device.

**An empty IPC answer is not a "no".** The escape-hatch check failed one run in
three, on a result it had actually got right: right after a full-screen surface
maps on this GPU the shell can be busy for long enough that `omarchy-shell`
gives up and prints nothing, and `"" == "closed"` is false. Driven by hand the
same gesture passed three times out of three, with the trace showing the
carousel lifting to 23% and springing back exactly as designed. Every state
read in the gesture suite retries now. A check that reports a transient as a
failure costs more than the bug it was looking for -- it teaches you to ignore
it.

**Measured: 315 MB RSS with all six plugins loaded and nothing opened yet,
351 MB after a session of driving every one of them, against 1118 MB
available.** Not a comparison with 6b's 361 MB -- that was measured after use,
and these two are the ends of the same range. The point is only that the sixth
plugin does not move it: the carousel holds one decoded icon per open window
and no textures. The selftest
covers all three stops with synthetic touch, and three consecutive clean runs:
55 samples opening the carousel, a card count that drops when a card is flicked
away, a focused workspace whose `representation` is empty after the home band,
and the drawer still tracking the finger at 47-49 samples -- from a blank
workspace, which is now the only place the strip can reach it from.

## 6d. Rebuilding the bottom edge against a written spec

6c described a bottom edge that passed 37/37 and was wrong. The drawer opened
from the nav strip, which is not where Android puts it, and it opened there
*most of the time* rather than only when it should have. Both of those are one
mistake, and the tests could not have caught it: they had been written to match
the code, so green only ever confirmed the inference that produced the code.

So the spec came first this time. `docs/gestures.md` is 34 numbered acceptance
criteria, each with the command that decides it, agreed before a line of QML
changed; the checks in `--gestures` name the ids they prove and the suite ends
by printing the ids it does not. That last part matters more than it sounds: a
gap nobody can see is the same as a gap nobody fixed.

**The bug and the redesign were the same fix.** The strip chose between the
carousel and the drawer by asking whether the focused workspace was empty,
through `I3.focusedWorkspace.lastIpcObject.representation`. That value is
refreshed on *workspace* events, so a workspace that was empty when it was
created and later received a window still reads empty -- which is "most of the
time". Moving the drawer onto the home screen deletes the question rather than
fixing the answer, and nothing in the gesture plugin asks about workspace
occupancy any more.

**Layer order replaced the predicate.** The home-screen surface is full-screen
on the **Bottom** layer: above the wallpaper, below every window. On a blank
workspace it receives the touch; on an occupied one the app is over it and it
receives nothing. No test, no staleness, and nothing to get wrong -- and
because it can never intercept what an app would have received, a bug in it
cannot make the touchscreen unusable. `gaps outer 0` is what makes this exact
rather than approximate: a lone window reaches the screen edge, so there is no
border for it to catch a stray swipe in.

**The back gesture is the one place that does steal input from apps.** It has
to sit above windows to work, so it is 16px on Overlay and, like the strip, it
never grows -- the worst a bug there can do is cost 16px down one side. Looking
at how Android does it was worth more for what it *cannot* lend us than for its
numbers: Android has the same tap-swallowing problem and solves it with
`setSystemGestureExclusionRects`, letting an app carve regions back out, capped
at 200dp per edge -- a limit sized explicitly as four 48dp touch targets. There
is no Wayland equivalent. So this edge is strictly more expensive here than on
Android, with no mitigation available to apps, and the fix if it bites is to
narrow it or drop it rather than to go looking for an API that does not exist.
Android also declines to publish a fixed inset at all: it is device-configurable,
user-adjustable, and queryable by apps. Three admissions that no one number is
right, so ours is a property rather than a constant in a binding.

**`ToplevelManager.activeToplevel` reads null with a window plainly focused.**
The back gesture found nothing and closed nothing while `toplevels` was
populated the whole time. The per-toplevel `activated` flag does track focus --
it is what puts the accent border on the right card -- so both the back gesture
and the carousel's ordering now prefer the singleton and fall back to the flag
that works. Worth noticing that the carousel had been leaning on the same
broken property for its "most recent first" ordering and looked fine, because
creation order happened to agree.

**Two hours went to environment, not code.** `sudo` resets PATH, so
`sudo moarchy-touch ...` is `command not found` -- and with output
redirected, a swipe that silently never happens. Every band read as "the
gesture does nothing" while the plugin was never sent one touch event. Then
`foot` would not map, because an ssh session has no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and the
shell reported `focus=none` -- which reads exactly like a broken plugin rather
than a missing variable. Both are fixed at the source now: `--gestures` derives
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` the way `moarchy-restart-shell` already derives
`SWAYSOCK`, and both invoke the injector by absolute path.

**A test that assumes state it could control is not a test.** G4 -- "back
closes the focused app" -- failed while the code was correct: `foot` had raised
squeekboard, and back is a priority order in which the keyboard outranks the
app, so it correctly dismissed the keyboard instead. The check now forces the
keyboard up, asserts back puts it down without closing anything (G2), forces it
down, and only then asserts the app closes (G4). Chasing that failure is what
produced the G2 check, which had not existed at all.

**16 checks over 14 ACs, three consecutive clean runs**, and seventeen ids
printed as uncovered. Two of those are worth naming: A9 needs every window on
the device closed, including the user's, so it is deliberately not run; and E5,
E6 and E1 are visual enough that a state dump would not prove them.

## 6e. Dragging the sheets shut

Two overlays could only be closed by a 26px band at the top of their own sheet.
Dragging on the body did nothing, and that was never a decision -- it was where
build-log 6b's investigation stopped once it had *a* working handle. The spec
had no ACs for it either, which is how a gap survives being written down.

**The same three-line pattern unlocked both, and it is the carousel's.** Every
tile and every app icon is a `MouseArea`, and a `MouseArea` holds the exclusive
grab for the whole gesture -- which is why 6b found a sheet-wide `DragHandler`
receiving exactly one event, and why an area placed *behind* the content never
sees a thing. So the controls do both jobs: a touch that never travels
activates, one past the slop drags the sheet shut.

**Scene coordinates, not local ones, and this is not a style preference.**
Every one of those MouseAreas is a child of the sheet, and the sheet is the
thing being moved. A delta measured in a frame that travels with the item it is
driving feeds back into itself. `mapToItem(null, ...)` is stationary, so a
finger that stops moving produces a delta that stops changing.

**`released` fires before `clicked`, and that cost an app launch.** The flag
saying "this was a drag, not a tap" was being cleared in the release handler,
so it was already false when the click arrived and the delegate launched
whatever the drag happened to start on. The symptom read as a *threshold* bug
-- a short drag that "closed" the drawer -- because launching an app dismisses
the drawer on the way out. The flag is cleared on the next press now.

**A `Flickable` swallows the press whether or not it has anything there.** Both
sheets stretched their list to fill: the drawer's `GridView` and the shade's
notification `ListView` each covered the empty sheet below their last row and
ate every drag that started in it. Capping each to `contentHeight` hands that
space back to the sheet, and gating `interactive` on overflow gives H5 for
free: while the list can scroll it owns vertical drags, and closing the shade
out from under someone reading their notifications is exactly the conflict this
gesture is not allowed to create.

**The brightness and volume sliders had to hand the gesture over rather than
share it.** They commit on *press* -- tap-to-set, which is right on a phone --
so by the time it is known whether the finger is going sideways or up, the
value has already moved. They now watch for a vertical drag, hand it to the
sheet, and put the value back, which for the live one means undoing a commit it
has already sent.

**Two edges had to be masked out of the shade.** It is on Overlay and maps when
it opens, so it lands *above* the always-mapped back-edge surface and swallowed
every left-edge swipe: back closed the drawer and the carousel and left the
shade untouched, because those two are on Top and this one is not. Its open
region already excluded the home pill's band along the bottom for the same
reason; it excludes the back edge down the left now too. A masked-out band
falls through to the next surface in the layer, which is the whole mechanism.

**Distance alone cannot commit a drag that starts near the far end.** Begin a
close 150px from the top of the shade and there is not 25% of the sheet left
above to travel through -- the gesture is unambiguous and the threshold is
unreachable. Speed settles those, the way it already did for the strip and the
grab band. Measured after: the shade closes from anywhere below the sliders on
a slow drag and from anywhere at all on a flick; the drawer closes on a long
drag from the search row, an icon, or empty sheet, and on a 90px flick; and a
60px slow drag on either still springs back.

## 6f. Three defects the first pass shipped

Found after the gesture work was committed, all three by looking at the shell
log *after* exercising the phone rather than after starting it. Nothing logs at
startup; these only speak once a finger moves.

**`var` is function-scoped, so a declaration inside an `if` is hoisted and
undefined.** `var now = Date.now()` sat inside the latched branch of
`onUpdated`, and `root.lastT = now` at the bottom ran on every touch move --
including the un-latched ones, where `now` had never been assigned. QML rejects
`undefined` for a double and logs it, so `lastT` silently kept a stale value and
the first latched frame measured its velocity over the wrong interval. Same
shape in two handlers, because the second was written from the first.

**`representation` went stale in the one place it was left.** `firstFreeWorkspace()`
asked each workspace whether its layout string was empty -- the same field, and
the same staleness, that made the strip open the drawer when it should have
opened the carousel: it changes on *window* events while I3 refreshes
workspaces on *workspace* events. Home switched onto an occupied workspace, and
the check named the bug for itself:
`the home drag left workspace 2 holding 'V[moa-selftest]'`. Existence does not
go stale the same way -- Sway destroys an empty workspace as soon as it loses
focus -- so it picks the lowest number the list does not contain, and asks
nothing about contents. The lesson is narrower than "do not use
representation": a value refreshed on one class of event cannot answer a
question about another.

Also here: home from home used to hop to a *different* empty workspace. There
is a reliable emptiness test after all, just not that one -- no toplevel is
`activated` while focus is on an empty workspace, which is the same property
the back gesture had to fall back to when `activeToplevel` read null.

**Powering the panel on does not turn touch back on.** `moarchy-screen`
disables the touch input with the display, so after an idle blank every
synthetic swipe lands nowhere and the suite fails wholesale for a reason that
has nothing to do with gestures. It cost an hour once already; the suite
enables the input explicitly now.

**And one piece of polish.** The shade's gear and power glyphs sat 1.5 device
pixels left of their circles. `anchors.centerIn` shrink-wraps the Text to the
glyph and then centres *that*, which lands the item on a fractional x --
(36 - 13.39) / 2 -- and the ink with it. Filling the button and letting Text
align inside keeps the item on integer coordinates. TextMetrics was tried
first and is what ruled out the obvious suspect: it reported the ink as already
centred *within the item*, which pointed at the item's placement rather than
the font's bearings. Measured after: the gear moved from -1.5 to +0.5 device
pixels, the power glyph stayed at -1.5 because its ink genuinely overhangs its
cell to the left, and at that size both read as centred.

## 6g. One phone, three sessions

Most of an afternoon's "flaky gesture tests" were not flaky and were not
gestures. Two other Claude sessions were driving the same PinePhone: one
scp'ing plugins and restarting the shell every few minutes, one running
input-method lifetime tests that deliberately parked focus on an empty
workspace. The tells were all there and I read every one of them as my own
bug first: windows nobody in this session had spawned (`moa-kbdtest`, a KDE
Calculator), workspace numbering at **19**, and a seat where the workspace was
focused and no window inside it was -- after which `swaymsg '[app_id=...]
focus'` returns success and changes nothing.

The most expensive one: **squeekboard had been killed and replaced**, with
another implementation owning `sm.puri.OSK0`. The G2 check -- "a back swipe
dismisses the keyboard and leaves the app open" -- was therefore testing
somebody else's keyboard, and I had already started rewriting the probe to
chase what I took to be my own defect. Asking cost one message and would have
cost nothing an hour earlier.

**What that says about the suite**, beyond "coordinate": a check that fails
because of the environment must say so. Three now do.

- G4 asserts its precondition. If Sway has no focused window, it reports *that*
  rather than blaming the back gesture -- which is right to do nothing there,
  because "no toplevel activated" is also how a home screen looks (G5).
- F2 asserts what its criterion actually says. "Going home never closes
  anything" is `after >= before`, not `after == before`; the stricter version
  failed when an unrelated app finished starting mid-run.
- G2 forces the keyboard up rather than hoping. An unforced run of that check
  is what made G4 look broken while it was correctly obeying G2's priority.

**Two real defects came out of the noise**, both of which would have bitten a
real user:

- The keyboard probe could act on a stale answer. `Process.running = true` on
  a process that is already running is a no-op, so a probe still in flight
  from the previous gesture left `keyboardKnown` false and `keyboardUp`
  whatever it was last time -- and back closed an app while the keyboard was
  plainly up. It toggles `running` off first now, retries a bounded six times,
  and if it still has no answer it takes the *keyboard* branch, because
  dismissing a keyboard is reversible and closing an app is not.
- Back did nothing at all in the stranded-focus state. `focusedToplevel()`
  returns null there while a window is plainly on screen, so the gesture fell
  through to G5's "nothing to undo". It falls back to `kill` now -- the same
  close request, addressed to whatever Sway considers focused, which reaches
  the window in that state and is a no-op on a genuinely empty workspace, so
  G5 still holds.

**And one fix that was a workaround.** The suite had grown a discarded warm-up
gesture because the first real gesture of a run was sometimes swallowed. The
cause is that a fresh uinput device needs longer than `moarchy-touch`
waited for Sway to map it to an output. Every caller pays that wait anyway, so
it is 2s now and the warm-up is gone. A warm-up that exists to survive a
too-short sleep is the sleep being wrong.

## 6h. Settings: the menu becomes screens

Omarchy's menu is 320 entries. The phone's Settings screen was eight rows, seven
of which summoned `omarchy.menu` at a route and handed over the desktop list.
That list is a popup, and `install/port-4x.sh` stubs out `HyprlandFocusGrab`
because Quickshell.I3 has no counterpart — so it does not dismiss on
tap-outside. The physical power button was bound straight into it.

**Classify before building.** All 320 entries went into `docs/menu-coverage.md`
first, each exactly once, as Native / Bridged / Shade / Unsupported. The table
is generated against the pinned `omarchy-menu.jsonc` rather than transcribed, so
no id can be invented or missed, and the split came out 66 / 75 / 1 / 178. The
two thirds that are dropped are Steam, twenty language runtimes behind `mise`,
six browsers with no aarch64 build, and Hyprland's own config files.

**One shim covered 128 rows.** They are all
`omarchy-launch-floating-terminal-with-presentation <script>`, every script it
names exists upstream, and our `bin/` shadows `$OMARCHY_PATH/bin` by PATH order.
Replacing that one wrapper — upstream's logo/done presentation kept verbatim,
only the terminal swapped for a foot at font 7, fullscreened at the time (§6m) — made all of them
work with nothing reimplemented. 65 of the bridged rows run a command
byte-identical to upstream's `action`; the selftest asserts it.

**Guards batch per page, not per tree.** Upstream evaluates all ~90 shell
conditions at once because a dmenu you type into must know what every row would
match before you have typed. A stack shows one page, so it asks about one:
opening the root costs three reads and no `pacman`, and eleven of the
thirty-six pages cost nothing at all. Repeated readers are captured once, the
way `MenuModel.js` does it, so the nine-row agent page forks
`omarchy-default-agent` once rather than nine times.

**A shell heredoc ate 55 icons.** Every glyph in `omarchy-menu.jsonc` below
U+FFFF is three bytes of UTF-8; the supplementary-plane ones are four. Writing
`Pages.js` through a bash heredoc dropped exactly the three-byte ones, leaving
`glyph: ""` on 55 of 141 rows — which renders as a row with no icon and a label
sitting where the icon should have been, and reads as a design choice rather
than a defect. **The existing icon check passed all 55**: it asks whether a
literal is one character and whether a font covers it, and an empty literal is
neither multi-character nor uncovered. Write glyphs from explicit codepoints
with a file write, never through a shell.

The check that catches it now was itself wrong first. Matching row objects with
a brace-matching regex skipped every row containing a nested `covers: { ... }`
— it found 6 of 55 against a deliberately broken copy. It is line-based now,
and it was verified against that broken copy rather than against the good file.
A check only proven on passing input has not been proven.

**Three switches wrote state nothing read.** `moarchy-toggle-bar` did
`pkill -x quickshell`, which made sense when the bar was all the shell drew and
now takes the drawer, the shade, the gesture strip and Settings with it — from a
row labelled "Menu Bar". `omarchy-bar transparent` committed to `shell.json`
while `Bar.qml` held an unbound `property bool transparent: false`. (Binding it
made the write show, and using it then showed what the write costs -- the switch
is gone now; see below.) Battery
percentage had no reader at all. And Stay Awake would have read and written its
flag correctly while `swayidle` blanked the screen anyway, because nothing under
Sway consulted it.

Negative polarity is the convention here and it is easy to get backwards:
`bar-off`, `screensaver-off`, `crash-capture-off`, `suspend-off` and now
`battery-percentage-off` all mean the feature is **off** when the file exists. An
inverted switch still toggles, still persists, still survives a restart — it is
merely wrong, and wrong-but-consistent survives review. `invert: true` lives in
the row data with a test per flag.

**The first back gesture after a shell restart is not yours.** `performBack()`
takes the keyboard branch whenever its probe has not answered, deliberately,
because hiding the keyboard is the reversible outcome. So a test that issues one
`gestures back` right after a restart is testing the probe's timing, not the
gesture — it failed once here and looked exactly like a real regression.

**Contrast has to be measured, not reasoned about — and not on one theme.**
Sampling pixels from a device screenshot: labels 9.47:1, detail lines
**4.50:1** — AA to two decimal places, with the antialiased glyph edges below
it. The cause is that subtitles sit on a raised card rather than the
background, and that 8% lift is what eats the margin.

Raising the alpha and calling it fixed was the mistake underneath the mistake.
Catppuccin happened to be on the phone, and it is one of the *forgiving* themes
for that pair. Run across all 22 `colors.toml` files, foreground at 0.7 over the
card is below AA in six of them and reaches **3.14:1 on rose-pine**;
`moarchy.themes`, at a flat 0.6 on the bare background, was **2.72:1**.
One theme measured and 21 assumed.

No constant is defensible here. At 0.55 — quiet enough to read as secondary —
18 of 22 are under AA. At 0.9 — the lowest value that clears AA everywhere —
the subtitle is within ten percent of its label and the hierarchy the alpha
existed to create is gone. A constant has to be tuned for the worst theme and is
therefore wrong for the other 21. So the colour is computed per theme: start at
0.55 and walk toward the foreground only until the pair clears 4.5:1. Worst case
becomes 4.52:1 and sixteen of the twenty-two stay below 0.70.

The measurement must use the *composited* background. The card is 8% alpha over
the base, and a sweep naming two palette roles cannot express that — it reports
the base or `lighter_background`, and both overstate the contrast. The
moarchy-keyboard session and this one arrived at the same six failing themes and
the same 3.14:1 from independent implementations once its checker grew a
`mix(base;over;alpha)` form, which is better evidence than either of us checking
our own arithmetic.

### Three the Settings screens shipped, found by using them

**Confirm did nothing.** The Continue button cleared `confirmText` and then called
`activate(row)` -- and `activate` armed the sheet whenever `row.confirm` was set
and `confirmText` was empty, which it now was. So every tap re-armed the dialog
it was dismissing: the sheet stayed up, the action never ran, and the button read
as dead rather than as looping. Confirmation is a parameter now, not a reading of
the state the caller has just cleared.

**Suspend locked a phone out.** `install/config.sh` starts `sway-session.target`
so that 4.x's user units come up at all, and one of those is
`omarchy-sleep-lock`. Suspending therefore locks the session, and the lock is an
ext-session-lock surface -- under that protocol the compositor draws the locker
and nothing else, so the on-screen keyboard is hidden by the very prompt asking
for a password. Touch-only, that is unrecoverable without ssh.

This is the trap `autostart.conf` and `moarchy-system-lock` already
document and defend against, and the defence did not reach here: our shim guards
`omarchy-system-lock`, the *script*, while the sleep unit and the shell's own
`omarchy.lock` service raise their locker directly. Guarding a script does not
guard the capability. `system.suspend` is Unsupported until the sleep unit is
masked and that is verified on the device -- and it is worth doing, because
suspend on a phone is worth having.

**Transparency traded the bar away for a colour.** Tapping the row did change
the status bar: upstream's `omarchy.bar` appeared in place of the phone bar and
stayed there. The row wrote through `omarchy-bar transparent`, which commits
`shell.json` and then asks the running shell to reload its config, and only one
thing in `shell.qml` can put the built-in bar on screen -- `activeBarId` falling
back to `defaultBarId`, which happens when the plugin bar fails to load
(`failedBarId`) or when the registry answers that it is unavailable. So the
reload unseated ours; which of those two branches it took was not narrowed down
on the device, because the answer would not change what to do about it.

Removed rather than repaired. The reload is the last line of `commit` in
`omarchy-shell-config`, shared by every `omarchy-bar` verb, so nothing about how
carefully the flag is bound would have helped -- the earlier fix bound
`transparent` to `barConfig` precisely so the write would show, and the write
was never the problem. Both halves are gone: the row, and `toggleTransparency`,
the one function in `Bar.qml` whose whole body was that command. Its absence is
the documented survivable case -- `omarchy-shell shell toggleBarTransparency`
now answers `no-bar` and stops, writing nothing.

The bar is opaque unconditionally, and ignoring `bar.transparent` is the
deliberate half of that: a phone whose `shell.json` still carries the flag from
before would otherwise come back transparent with the switch that set it gone
from the UI. `style.bar.transparency` is Unsupported in `menu-coverage.md`, C6
in `settings.md` says what has to stay gone, and the selftest asserts it against
the live page and the installed `Bar.qml` rather than by calling the IPC -- a
check that proved the point by taking the bar down would be its own defect.

## 6i. Three fixes that came from other people's measurements

**A single alpha cannot make secondary text readable.** `subdued` was
foreground at 0.6, and against the surfaces it actually sits on -- a raised
card, a container tile, the sheet -- that measured 3.95-4.29:1 where 4.5:1 is
the threshold. Raising it to 0.75 cleared all three, and that fix was still
wrong: it was calibrated against one theme. Measured across all 22, foreground
at 0.7 over a lifted card fails in six of them and reaches **3.14:1 on
rose-pine**, while Catppuccin passes the same pair at 5.44 -- so the theme I
happened to be running is one of the most forgiving for it. The constant that
clears AA everywhere is 0.9, at which point a subtitle is within ten percent of
its label and the hierarchy the alpha existed to create is gone.

So it is computed per theme now: start at 0.55 and walk toward the foreground
only until the pair clears 4.5:1, measured against the **composited**
background rather than the surface, because `container` is painted with alpha
and measuring against the surface alone overstates the contrast by the width of
that lift. Every theme ends up as quiet as it can afford. Verified on rendered
pixels, not arithmetic: 6.97:1 for the shade's date line.

**The first back gesture after a shell restart was being eaten by its own
probe.** `performBack` takes the keyboard branch whenever the probe has not
answered -- correct, because that branch is the reversible one -- but the DBus
path is cold on the first call and the whole retry budget goes on it. The probe
is warmed once at startup now, so the first real gesture is not the one that
pays for the connection.

**A suite that inherits the last session's state is measuring the last
session.** One run in three failed A1/A3 with "0 samples", which reads as a
dead gesture and was nothing of the kind: a shade left open from an earlier
screenshot meant the strip's up-drag correctly meant "put that away" (A8), so
the recents drag never latched. The gesture was behaving exactly as specified
and failing a check that assumed a bare screen. A4 then passed *because* it
closed the shade, which is how the failure looked intermittent rather than
positional. The gesture block now closes every overlay before it starts, and
that is verified the only way worth verifying it: by running three passes from
a deliberately dirty start, with the shade open, and getting 43/43 three times.

All three came from someone else looking. The contrast sweep started in another
session; the probe timing was reported by a third; the dirty-state failure was
mine, found only because the other two had already cleared the noise around it.

## 6j. A cleanup pass that deleted the phone

Plugins are installed by copying every directory under
`default/omarchy/plugins/` into `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/`, and a plugin that
ships a `.desktop` has it moved into `~/.local/share/applications` so the drawer
lists it like an app. Nothing removed either one when a plugin left the repo. The
loop only iterates what the repo still ships, so a deleted plugin is never
visited: its directory stayed, the shell went on loading it, its id stayed in
`shell.json`, and its icon stayed in the drawer launching nothing. Another
session spotted the orphaned icon; checking it found the other two.

The sweep that fixes it derives the set of plugins the repo ships and removes any
installed `moarchy.*` not in that set. Desktop entries carry an
`X-Moarchy-Plugin=<id>` marker and are matched on it rather than on
filename, so an entry named after something else is still caught and an entry we
never installed is never touched.

**Then the interesting part.** I scoped the sweep to the `moarchy.*`
namespace so a user's third-party plugins could not be caught by it, dry-ran
exactly that -- stale one goes, third-party one stays -- and shipped it. What I
never ran was the branch that deletes. If `MOARCHY_PATH` is unset or wrong,
or `default/omarchy/plugins/` is missing or caught half-written by another
session's checkout in this shared worktree, the glob does not expand and the
derived set is **empty**. Every installed plugin then fails the membership test.
Reproduced against the committed version: bar, drawer, shade, recents, gestures,
settings, themes and device all deleted in one pass, leaving only the
third-party plugin the namespace scoping had so carefully protected. The copy
loop that would restore them iterates the same empty glob, so it restores
nothing. The phone comes up with no UI at all, recoverable only over ssh.

An empty derived list is not "everything is stale", it is "I could not read the
repo", and the two must not share a code path when one of them ends in `rm -rf`.
The sweep is skipped with a warning now. Skipping it leaves a stale icon, which
is the whole bug it was written to fix; running it on a half-read repo leaves no
phone. Same reasoning as upstream `omarchy-menu` discarding an incomplete batch
rather than acting on it.

Two things worth carrying forward. The first is that I dry-ran the branch that
was already correct and shipped the branch that deletes -- the safe path passing
says nothing about the destructive one, and this is the only `rm -rf` in the repo
aimed at a directory the user owns. `scripts/test-plugin-sweep.sh` now covers all
four branches over a fake `HOME`, needs no device, and extracts the sweep from
`install/config.sh` between marker comments so it tests the shipping code rather
than a copy of it. Against the unguarded version it fails three of four.

The second is a trap the sweep introduces: **provisioning is authoritative, so a
plugin hand-copied to the phone for testing is now deleted by the next
provision** rather than merely overwritten. That is correct behaviour and it is
silent. `moarchy.device` spent a day in exactly that state -- scp'd,
uncommitted, live -- and the next provision would have removed it. Commit a
plugin before you rely on it surviving.

## 6ja. Two surfaces, one edge

The on-screen keyboard was replaced, and the new one landed on the **Overlay**
layer -- the same layer as the gesture strip. Both reserve space, and the total
was right: 23 for the strip plus 200 for the keyboard, 223 reserved, nothing
lost. What a correct total does not say is *which surface gets the edge*, and
the keyboard was getting it: keys ran to y=720 and the home pill was displaced
to 497..520, stranded between the app and the keys.

**Exclusive zones resolve layer by layer, Overlay downward.** That is why the
strip beat squeekboard without anyone having to think about it -- squeekboard
was on Top, so the strip's zone was always resolved first and the edge was free.
Putting a second surface on Overlay replaced that guarantee with intra-layer
map order, which is a race. The fix was for the keyboard to go back to Top,
where the ordering is decided by the layer rather than by who happened to map
first.

**Six failures, identical across three runs, and none of them were the
gestures.** B1, A1/A3, A4 and D1 all swipe at y=710 logical, which used to be
the strip and had become the middle of the keyboard; E3 cascaded from A1/A3.
The gestures were behaving correctly the whole time and the tests were aiming
at where the strip used to be. Worth separating from the day's other failures:
those were contention and leftover state, this one was reproducible, and the
difference between "fails three times identically" and "fails one run in three"
is the difference between a regression and an environment.

**A correct total is not evidence of a correct arrangement**, and that mistake
was mine twice over. I warned that sharing a layer turns the exclusion into a
race, was shown a measurement proving both surfaces reserved the right amount,
and retracted -- when the measurement was compatible with either order and
never addressed the question. The screenshot is what settled it, because a
screenshot cannot be compatible with both.

**Assert the interface, not the implementation.** The session check asserted
`squeekboard` by process name and went red the moment the keyboard changed,
reporting a working phone as broken and naming the wrong cause. It asks whether
*something* owns `sm.puri.OSK0` now -- which is the actual contract, the one
`moarchy-toggle-keyboard` and the back gesture both drive. The same error
in the other direction cost a peer session an afternoon: its suite reported
confidently on squeekboard while a different implementation owned the name.

46/0, three consecutive runs, against the replacement keyboard.

## 6k. Drawing under the bottom strip

Six full-screen surfaces, and until now two of them behaved differently from the
other four for no reason anybody had decided. `recents` and `shade` are
`ExclusionMode.Ignore` and take the whole output. The drawer, Settings, the theme
picker and `device` are Top with a zero exclusive zone, so sway arranges them
*into* the usable area -- and each stopped at the top of the gesture strip,
leaving a 20px band of wallpaper along the bottom edge with the home pill drawn
on it. The drawer's scrim did not cover that band either, so it was the one part
of the screen that did not join the open animation.

The three sheets now extend under the strip. `device` deliberately does not --
see below.

**`ExclusionMode.Ignore` was the obvious fix and is wrong twice.** It takes the
whole output, so it would also swallow the top status bar; and the zero exclusive
zone is the entire reason the drawer's search field works, because a surface that
reserves nothing is *arranged around* the keyboard instead of being buried by it
(6b, 6c). What is wanted is one edge, not both.

**A negative bottom margin is the mechanism, and it is legal rather than a
trick.** Sway does no box arithmetic of its own: `arrange_surface()` hands off to
wlroots' `wlr_scene_layer_surface_v1_configure()` and adds no validation.
`wlr_layer_surface_v1_state.margin` is **`int32_t`** -- signed, so a negative
margin is a first-class protocol value -- and for a surface anchored top+bottom
with a desired height of 0 that function computes

```c
box.y      = bounds.y + state->margin.top;
box.height = bounds.height - (state->margin.top + state->margin.bottom);
```

with no clamping and no `max()`. `margin.bottom = -20` therefore adds 20 to the
height and leaves the top alone: still below the bar, now down to the screen
edge. Measured, before and after, on the device: `h` 674 -> 694 against a 720px
screen and a 26px bar.

`Bar.qml` already ships `margins.top: -barSize` to hide the bar, but that is
weaker precedent than it looks -- it runs with `Ignore` and a fixed height, which
is the `exclusive_zone == -1`, `desired_height != 0` path. It proves Quickshell
forwards a negative margin rather than clamping it in its own API. It does not
exercise this arrangement, which is why AC I2 exists.

**The pill keeps working with no mask and no geometry**, because these three are
on Top and the strip is on Overlay, and every Overlay surface sits above every
Top one -- the same property that already let the carousel take the whole output
(6c). The shade needs a mask only because it is on Overlay itself.

**`moarchy.device` is the control, and that is why it was left alone.**
Layer surfaces are invisible to sway's IPC: `swaymsg -t get_tree` does not list
them, so there is no way to ask the compositor how tall a layer surface is. Each
plugin answers a new `geometry` verb instead, reporting the configure its
`PanelWindow` received. `h` is the compositor's number; `margin` read back is
only our own property and proves the assignment was accepted, never that it was
honoured. With `device` unchanged -- same layer, same zero zone, no margin -- the
assertion is `sheet_h == device_h + strip`, and the difference is the margin and
nothing else.

That indirection is not fastidiousness. The obvious version, against the
workspace rect, is wrong: the rect reads `29 668` on a 720px screen where the
bar is 26 and the strip 20, because `gaps inner 3` insets it at both edges. An
absolute assertion would have failed on arithmetic while the behaviour was
correct.

**Three things the first pass got wrong, each caught by measurement.**

- **The grid's height cap defeats its own scroll padding.** `bottomMargin` is
  what keeps the last row from resting under the pill, but the drawer's grid is
  `height: Math.min(parent.height - y, contentHeight)` -- capped so it cannot
  swallow the close-drag below the last row (6e). With the margin outside the
  cap, a grid whose apps fit becomes scrollable by exactly the margin, which
  makes it interactive where it was not and hands it the H1 drag. The cap has to
  be `contentHeight + bottomMargin`.

- **The first I1 check compared the wrong two pixels.** It sampled the last row
  against a pixel one strip higher, expecting both to be sheet. On Settings the
  higher sample landed on a row card, so it compared card against sheet and
  failed a surface that was reaching the edge perfectly well. What I1 actually
  asks is whether that band is the sheet or still what is behind -- a question
  about the *difference between open and closed*, which is what it samples now
  (`76193C -> 1A1B26`, wallpaper to sheet).

- **The keyboard gate that looked necessary and was not.** The tempting version
  is `margins.bottom: searchField.activeFocus ? 0 : -strip`, so nothing goes
  behind the keyboard. Measured, the content position is invariant either way:
  with the keyboard up the surface shortens by exactly the keyboard's zone
  (694 -> 494) and `gap` holds at 30, because the Flickable's trailing margin is
  scroll padding and absorbs it. Only blank sheet goes behind the keyboard, and
  blank sheet behind a keyboard is invisible. Gating would have cost something
  real: `closeTravel` and the sheet's `y` both read `drawerWindow.height`, so
  flipping the margin mid-gesture would jump the sheet and break the 1:1 travel
  6e exists to defend.

**The pill's contrast does not change, and the number is worse than anyone had
checked.** At rest the pill is `Util.alpha(Color.foreground, 0.3)`. Over the
wallpaper it composites to `4A3E53` on `150D20`; over the drawer's sheet to
`45485B` on `1A1B26`. Both are **1.90:1**. That equality is structural rather
than lucky: a constant-alpha overlay's contrast against its own backdrop is set
by the alpha and the foreground-to-background gap, very nearly independently of
what is behind. So this change moves the pill from an unbounded backdrop to a
known one without moving the number -- and it also means 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11) is
unreachable at 0.3 and never was reached. Whether 0.3 is the right resting alpha
is a real question at 1.90:1, but it is a question about the pill, not about what
is drawn behind it, and AC I7 is written not to smuggle it in.

**A negative margin does not mean "under the strip", and that cost two bugs.**
It means "past the bottom of the usable area", and what sits there is whatever
is reserving at the time. With the keyboard down that is the strip -- Overlay,
above everything, exactly what was wanted. With the keyboard up it is the
keyboard, which is on Top like the drawer and mapped earlier, so the drawer won
the overlap and painted over it: the whole `qwertyuiop` row reduced to a sliver
under the drawer's app labels. The content compensation is no help, because the
grid's `bottomMargin` moves the last row and not the surface. The drawer's inset
is now dropped while its search field has focus.

That is the argument three paragraphs up, reversed by a screenshot. Every step
of it was sound about *content* and it never asked what the surface was landing
on. What settled it was cropping the boundary out of a capture and looking at
it -- the third time in this log that reading pixels rather than reasoning about
them is what found the bug.

**And the keyboard under-reserved by exactly its own inset.** Running
`moarchy-keyboard`'s background under the strip needs the same negative margin,
and sway reduces the usable area by `exclusive_zone + margin.bottom` rather than
by the zone alone. So a 200px panel with a -24 margin reserved 176, the drawer
was arranged 24px lower than it should have been, and it clipped the top key
row. The zone carries `+ stripInset` to cancel it. The keys had not moved in
either bug, which is what made both look like paint bugs rather than
arrangement ones.

**A session that has been driving overlays for a while stops raising the
keyboard.** The tap lands, the injector is fine -- the same one still drives
every gesture check in the same run -- and the search field simply never
activates its text input again. `moarchy-restart-shell` clears it every
time. `--surfaces` skips I5 rather than failing it when the keyboard will not
come up, because a check that reports a stale session as a defect teaches you to
ignore it (the same reasoning as the retry on every state read in 6c).


## 6l. From installer to image, and the four bugs only hardware found

2026-09-06. The project went from a config overlay with a 1147-line on-device
installer to a flashable image, released as 0.1.0. The sequence was M1 pins →
M2 one pacman transaction → M4 the image; M3, the published package repo, was
skipped because a local `file://` repo satisfies `pacstrap` exactly as well as a
published one, and only the *update* path needs publishing.

`docs/structure.md` carries the decisions. What belongs here is what building it
and then booting it actually found, because the split between those two is the
interesting part.

**Four were found by building.** A container caught all of them:

1. A hand-picked device package set (`linux-megi uboot-pinephone
   danctnix-tweaks`) that looked like the device stack and omitted
   `linux-firmware-realtek` — **no wifi**. DanctNIX's own explicitly-installed
   list, read out of `/var/lib/pacman/local` in their release image, uses one
   meta package, `device-pine64-pinephone`, which pulls the firmware, the modem
   and the brightness and proximity udev rules too.
2. `jack2` chosen over `pipewire-jack` by a provider prompt with no tty.
3. `OMARCHY_PATH` set but not exported, so `omarchy-theme-set` answered
   "Theme 'tokyo-night' does not exist" with the theme sitting in
   `/usr/share/omarchy/themes`.
4. Upstream's `install/` excluded from `omarchy-config` while a dozen runtime
   `omarchy-*` scripts source out of it.

**Four needed the phone**, and every one was a *composition* bug — each
individual file present, correct, and verified:

5. `moarchy-firstboot` wrote the tty1 autologin drop-in but raced `getty@tty1`,
   so the first boot stopped at a login prompt that a **locked password cannot
   answer**. The image build knows the username, so the drop-in is written at
   build time now.
6. `/etc/profile` sources `profile.d` in sorted order, and
   `zz-moarchy-session.sh` sorts *before* `zz-moarchy.sh` — `-` is 0x2D, `.` is
   0x2E. The session `exec`'d sway before the file that puts
   `/usr/lib/moarchy/bin` on `PATH` ran, so `swaybg` painted the wallpaper and
   `moarchy-restart-shell` was simply not found: no bar, no gesture strip, and
   **no log**, because the missing script is the one that writes the log. They
   are one file now.
7. `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink to systemd-resolved's stub and resolved was
   not enabled, so it dangled: raw IPs routed, **no name resolved**, and pacman
   could not reach a mirror.
8. `systemctl enable` without `--now` in a script that runs *during* first boot,
   so NetworkManager was enabled and not started — Wi-Fi could not be switched
   on at all until the phone had been rebooted once.

The lesson is not "test on hardware", which everyone already believes. It is
that 4 and 5–8 are different *kinds* of defect: the first four are wrong
contents, which a container can read, and the last four are wrong relationships
between things that are each individually right, which it cannot.

### The suite had to be made able to fail

`image/verify.sh` grew to 75 checks (86 as of 0.2.0) and `image/negative-test.sh` exists because
of what happened when it did not. Four checks in the first version were wrong in
both directions — two passed vacuously, and two reported a correctly enabled
unit as missing, because `-e` follows an absolute symlink out of the mounted
image. The negative control plants six defects in a copy and requires the
verifier to catch all six and exit non-zero.

Two checks were written *after* a bug slipped through, and both had the same
shape: they measured the fixed-up state rather than the shipped one. The
autologin check ran `moarchy-firstboot` and *then* asserted the drop-in existed,
so it passed while the image had none. The session check now simulates a tty1
login with `sway` replaced by a stub that reports the environment it was handed;
run against the image that failed, it reports exactly what the phone did.

### Restarting the shell over ssh is not the same as restarting it

Worth its own line because it wasted an hour and looked like a product bug.
`moarchy-restart-shell` run from an ssh session starts quickshell as a child of
*that* session, so it lands in a `tty` scope with **no seat** rather than sway's
`session-1.scope` on `seat0`. polkit then cannot match `allow_active`, falls
through to `allow_any` (`auth_admin` for NetworkManager), and raises an
authentication dialog — for a password this image deliberately does not have, on
a 360px screen where its buttons are off-frame. "System policy prevents Wi-Fi
scans", and a modal you cannot dismiss.

Restart it through the compositor instead, so it inherits the seated session:

```bash
swaymsg exec moarchy-restart-shell
```

`cat /proc/$(pgrep -x quickshell)/cgroup` must name the same scope as
`pgrep -x sway`.

### And the tooling lied twice, in the same way

`scripts/card-push.sh` — the way into a phone with no network, since the image
ships `sshd` disabled and a locked password — created `~/.ssh` and `~/pkgs` as
regular **files**, so every write beneath them failed, and its output filter was
wide enough to swallow the evidence: it printed nothing and reported success. It
stats every destination back out of the filesystem now and checks its *type*.

The same script then refused to declare a card clean because `debugfs` had left
the block and inode bitmaps out of step with the superblock — which is what
`debugfs` always does, and what `fsck` is for. Reporting the ordinary
consequence of its own write as "do NOT boot it; re-flash instead" is the worst
possible advice to give someone whose only route into the phone is the card they
have just been told to erase.

## 6m. Two doors locked from the inside (2026-09-06)

Neither of these was a crash, and neither showed up in a check. Both were a
feature that ran exactly as written and could not be used.

**The store asked for a password the image does not have.** `moarchy-store`
installs through `pkexec`, and its polkit action is `auth_self_keep` — prove you
are you, then keep it for a while. `image/configure.sh` runs `passwd -l` on the
account, deliberately: tty1 autologin never consults a password and a published
image must ship no secret. So the dialog appeared, nothing could be typed into
it that would ever be right, `pkexec` exited 127, and the store reported "Wrong
password, or not authorised" for every app in the catalogue.

The fix is a polkit rule in this package —
`default/polkit/49-moarchy-store.rules` — granting `org.moarchy.store.manage` to
`wheel` outright. What makes that reasonable is where the action points: not at
pacman, but at a helper that refuses any package outside the root-owned
catalogue (or a published one `gpgv` verifies, whose serial is not older). And
the same user already holds `ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` from
`/etc/sudoers.d/10-moarchy`, so this is the narrower of two doors that were
already open. It lives here rather than in the store's own `.policy` because
"this image has no password" is the image's decision, not the component's.

**The AUR row drew a prompt over a keyboard nobody could touch.** Settings ▸
Install from the AUR bridges to `omarchy-pkg-aur-install`, which asks for a
package name. The terminal appeared, the keyboard did not, and the row was a
dead end.

`pinephone.conf` fullscreened every `moa-tui` window. Sway draws a fullscreen
view *above* the Top layer and routes touches to it alone — the same fact that
put the launch splash on Overlay months earlier (`windows.md` L2a) — and
`moarchy-keyboard`'s panel is on Top on purpose: on Overlay it maps before the
home strip and takes the bottom exclusive zone the pill needs. So the keyboard
was raised, present on the bus, and drawn underneath the terminal.

The rule bought nothing it was written for. It was there for columns, and the
columns never came from fullscreen: the bar anchors top and the keyboard anchors
bottom, so both cost rows and neither costs a character of width. What buys
btop's 60 columns is `moarchy-launch-tui`'s font size 7, tiled or not. Tiling
also restores the reservation — the keyboard claims an exclusive zone when it
comes up, so the prompt is pushed above the keys instead of sitting behind
them, which a fullscreen window ignores. The rule is gone and `windows.md` W5
says so as a criterion.

**Both were "verified".** Settings E5 read *a bridged TUI opens fullscreen,
identifiable, and typeable*, and checked typeable by watching `sm.puri.OSK0`
raise. The property was true the whole time the surface was invisible and
taking no touches. A check that cannot fail is not a check: E5 now wants
`fullscreen_mode: 0` and a keystroke that arrives.

## 6n. What a release would have shipped (2026-09-07)

A sweep of everything between `v0.1.0` and here, before cutting the next image.
Four findings, and what they have in common is that none of them is a bug in
running code: each is a *version*, a *directory* or a *sentence* that stopped
matching what the code does.

**`moarchy-meta` would not have upgraded.** Its `depends()` gained
gnome-contacts, geary, alligator, amberol, secrets and songrec and lost kclock
and index-fm, and `pkgver`/`pkgrel` did not move. pacman compares versions, not
contents, so a phone already holding `0.1.0-1` would never see any of it — the
same trap `manifest.toml` records for the keyboard and `pkgbuilds/moarchy`
records for its own bump. Checked against the published package rather than
assumed: `moarchy-meta-0.1.0-1`'s `.PKGINFO` carries 95 `depend` lines and none
of the six new names. Now `0.1.0-2`.

**`packages/` decides releases by glob order.** `docker/build-packages.sh` never
clears its output, which is correct — a build that fails halfway should not cost
what already built — so the directory accumulates. `repo-add ... *.pkg.tar.*`
and the image's `pacstrap` then take whichever file sorts last. That is not
hypothetical either: the published `repo` release carries `moarchy-store-git`
r19 **and** r22, `PKGDIR` exists because a `moarchy-0.1.0-2` from another
session was one glob away from being published, and `packages/` right now holds
the r19 store while `manifest.toml` pins r22. `scripts/pkgset.sh` refuses an
ambiguous directory and both builds print the set by name instead of by count
(R8).

**The image's keyring check could not fail.** `image/verify.sh` asserted that
`/usr/share/pacman/keyrings/moarchy.gpg` exists. pacman does not validate
against that file; it validates against `/etc/pacman.d/gnupg`, which
`moarchy-keyring`'s `post_install` populates and which swallows its own failure
into a line `pacstrap` buries. Had it ever silently failed, `SigLevel =
Required` would refuse every package in the repo and the phone's only symptom
would be that `pacman -Syu` stops. It now asks `pacman-key --gpgdir` and tells
three states apart — trusted, present-but-untrusted, absent — and all three were
watched happening in a container before the check was kept (R9).

**The README described a phone from two weeks ago.** It listed "`pacman -Syu`
does not update moarchy's own packages yet. There is no published package
repository" nine lines below a section explaining how to update with
`pacman -Syu` from the published package repository; and it kept the camera
under *Out of scope* as "`VIDIOC_STREAMON` fails on both sensors", which
`docs/apps.md` retired on 2026-09-06 — nothing was configuring the media graph,
which is what `libmegapixels` does. Four more sentences pointed at
`install/preflight.sh`, `install/telephony.sh`, `install/port-4x.sh` and
`install/build-src.sh`, none of which have existed since `ca129e8`.

Two stale selftest assertions went with them, both inherited from work that had
already landed. E1 activated the `screensaver` row that 1b01e5c deleted;
`activate` on a row that is not there does nothing, so `lastLaunch` kept block
C's value and E1 failed reading `moarchy-toggle-bar on` — a deleted row and a
broken bridge with identical symptoms. It now tests that the row exists first,
and uses `emoji`. And the S6b picker-parity check still read one *command* out
of each side, which S6b itself made false: both ends name the plugin
`moarchy.wifi`, `wifiPicker` is deliberately the empty string, and the sed for
`floating-terminal-with-presentation` fell through to the Bluetooth tile and
compared bluetui against a row naming no command at all. Wi-Fi is checked as a
plugin id now; the command parity moved to Bluetooth, which is still one TUI on
both sides (S6c).

## 6o. Auditing every row in Settings (2026-09-07)

All 33 pages walked row by row on the device through the `settings` IPC surface,
every `action` row's command resolved and read, and the launch paths exercised
with `grim` behind them. Nine defects, one of which was not about Settings at
all.

**Two ways of measuring were wrong before any of them were found**, and both are
worth more than the bugs. `goto` returns as soon as the page is pushed and the
`when:` guards go out afterwards as one batch (F4), so `rows` read immediately
reports `visible=0` for *every* guarded row: the first sweep showed a dozen empty
pages and three of them were real. And a non-login `ssh` to this phone lands in
`LC_CTYPE=POSIX`, where bash does not expand `$'\U000f0431'` — so every icon in
upstream's menu scripts stayed literal and the vendored picker rendered
`)00F0431` over each label. That was written down as a defect before the second
test; launched from Settings it inherits the shell's `LANG` and is fine. A UI has
to be tested the way the UI launches it.

**The one that was not a Settings bug.** `pacman -Sp vim` — out of `[extra]`,
nothing to do with our repo — failed:

```
error: moarchy: missing required signature
error: database 'moarchy' is not valid (invalid or corrupted database)
```

`image/build.sh` pacstraps with `[moarchy]` on a `file://` directory at
`SigLevel = Never`, so the database cached into the image has no signature.
`image/configure.sh` then writes the real stanza at `SigLevel = Required`, which
implies DatabaseRequired. The image ships a database its own configuration
refuses, and one unverifiable database stops the whole transaction — so the three
package rows, the eight More software rows and the six font installs were dead
together from first boot. Every part looks right in isolation, which is why it
lasted: the repo *is* signed, `moarchy.db.sig` *is* published, and the key is
trusted (`pacman-key --list-keys` shows it `[ full ]`). `pacman -Sy` repairs it
in one call; the image now does that at build time.

**The six that were the screen saying something it could not know.** `open()`
rebuilt the stack without the reset `push()`/`pop()` do, so an `openAt` onto a
provider page painted the *previous* provider page — "No reminders set" under a
"Font" header, surviving a close and reopen. Wallpaper ticked nothing because its
rows are paths and its reader prettified one (`1-quattro.jpg` → `Quattro`); the
reader answers the path now and the label does the prettifying. Font ticked
nothing for a different and legitimate reason — `fc-match` falls back to a family
`fc-list :spacing=100` does not report — so D2 was correct and the page was still
useless, and the current value joins the list when the list omits it. `AI agent`
was always visible and always opened an empty screen. `omarchy-version` reads
`pacman -Q omarchy` on an image that installs `omarchy-config`, so About's
headline row was blank. And the Wi-Fi row ran `omarchy-network-status`, which
answers a four-field record for a bar widget: the whole record landed in the
detail line and its tabs shifted every column of the `rows` TSV after it, so
`enabled` came back as an SSID.

**Four things that worked and were still not a phone UI.** `wiremix` mapped its
window and drew a truncated tab strip and nothing else — no device list, no
sliders, and it was the only audio UI the phone had. `omarchy-menu-timezone`
piped ~420 zones into a fixed card with a filter field to type into. Plugin
enable and disable were two separate launches of that card, neither of which ever
showed which plugins were on. `omarchy-launch-about` sizes itself by measuring
its own output from inside the terminal and re-execs with `--render`, which
qmlkonsole refuses. All four are screens now; 16 ids were expected to move
Bridged→Native and four did.

**And one that was offering a setting it could not honour.** Branding's six rows
edited two files of ASCII art that nothing on this phone renders — About Omarchy
is a page of rows now, and `omarchy-screensaver` needs ttfx, which is why
`system.screensaver` was already Unsupported. 54 columns across 360 logical
pixels is six pixels a character, so there was no version of it to build either.
Gone, with the eight ids recorded as Unsupported and the reason with them.

Totals went 68/68/1 → **58 Bridged / 70 Native / 191 Unsupported**, still 320.
The Totals table in `menu-coverage.md` had drifted three behind since the
reminders change and was moved with them — a summary nothing asserts drifts,
which is the argument G7 already makes about its own constant. Two test hygiene
fixes came out of it as well: `dryRun` could only be written, and it is the
precondition for every check that activates a row without wanting it to happen,
so when *that* call was dropped the rows really fired and J9 went red saying
nothing about J9; and G5 counted the Unsupported half out of a doc the package
does not ship, so on a device it read 137 + 0 against 320 every run.

## 6p. The screenshot that had already been taken (2026-09-07)

Reported straight after the audit: Tools > Screenshot does not work. It did work,
and had written the file every time.

`moarchy-capture-screenshot` is grim, then satty -- the annotation editor -- then
`wl-copy`, then a notification. satty cannot start on this GPU:

```
GLib-WARNING **: Unable to create a GL context
```

Mali-400 tops out at GLES 2.0, which is the same ceiling that made this a port
rather than an install (section 0). satty does not exit on that error. It maps a
360x474 window that paints nothing and waits, so the script never reaches
`wl-copy` and never notifies. From the row, that is: Settings goes away (E6), an
invisible window takes focus, the keyboard rises to meet it, and nothing appears
to have happened -- while `~/Pictures/Screenshots` quietly filled up. Three files
were already sitting there, one of them from the user's own attempt minutes
before.

Two other things were wrong with the same eighteen lines, and both were silent.
`notify-send` is not on this image at all, so the only confirmation the row had
was `command not found` swallowed by its own `2>/dev/null` --
`omarchy-notification-send` is what exists here, and the shade shows it. And
`region` mode calls `slurp`, which needs something to drag on a seat that has no
pointer; it stays for the keyboard binding and the Settings row does not offer
it.

Worth recording as a shape rather than a bug: three of this session's findings
were a program that fails and *keeps running*. satty here, `omarchy-menu-select`
blocking on a done-file that never arrives, and `omarchy-launch-about` printing
`Unknown option 'render'` and leaving the terminal up. A crash is visible. A
process that holds the screen and does nothing reads as the feature not
existing.

## 6q. A shade the size of what is in it (2026-09-07)

The sheet was a fixed 90% of the usable height whatever it held, so an empty
shade was two thirds blank space below the sliders and a full one was no
bigger. `shade.md` had carried that as an open question -- **? S21** -- since
the sheet was written. (S15 and S17 are still marked `?`; S21 was the only one
about the sheet's geometry.) It is answered now: the
sheet is its content's height, capped at the same 90%, and at the cap the list
scrolls. Measured on the device: **330 logical px empty, 454 with one
notification, 630 at the cap**, against 630 for everything before.

**The cap stays, and it is not slack.** The band of scrim under the sheet is
the tap-to-dismiss target and where a thumb starts H2's up-drag; the drag
handle is the status bar, so a sheet allowed the full screen would leave an
upward drag starting within 26px of the top with nowhere to go. A short sheet
now hands back *more* of that band -- H2 got easier, not harder, and measured
52 drag samples on a 330 sheet against 16 on a 630 one.

**Half of it was already built.** The `ListView` was capped to `contentHeight`
with `interactive` gated on overflow -- the fix two sections up, which handed
the empty space back to the sheet's own drag. The list already took only what
it needed and already scrolled. What was missing was the sheet noticing.

**The whole change is one causality reversal, and everything else follows.**
The sheet's height used to flow down into the Column (`anchors.fill`) and into
the list (`parent.height - y`). It flows *up* now: list -> Column
`implicitHeight` -> `sheetWanted` -> sheet. Which makes the old downward reads
binding loops, so both had to go -- the Column anchors top/left/right, and the
list caps against `sheetMax` (a constant) minus its own `y`. `y` is safe where
`parent.height` is not, because a `Column` sets each child's y from the
children *before* it and the list is the last one. Qt answers a loop by
reporting it once and then leaving the property at whatever it last held, which
would render as a sheet stuck at one frame's guess.

Three things that were not obvious, all of which bit:

- **A `Column`'s bottom inset has nowhere to live once the Column stops
  filling.** `anchors.bottomMargin` is gone; the 18px moved into `sheetWanted`.
  Drop it and every card sits on the rounded corner.
- **An empty `ListView` is not a zero-height item.** Its height is
  `contentHeight + bottomMargin`, which with no rows is the margin alone -- and
  a *visible* zero-height child of a Column still takes a gap above it. Two
  stray bands at the foot of a sheet whose whole purpose is to end where its
  content does. It is `visible: historyRows.length > 0` now, read off the model
  rather than off `count` so that nothing deciding the height reads back out of
  the list item.
- **`contentHeight` does not include the Flickable's margins.** So the drawer's
  `+ bottomMargin` on the cap is required and does not double-count -- without
  it a list that exactly fits becomes scrollable by exactly the margin,
  interactive where it was not, swallowing the close drag the cap exists to
  protect. The shade's list was also the only one in the shell without
  `boundsBehavior: StopAtBounds`.

**The height must not move under a finger.** It is the divisor for both drag
mappings and the multiplier for the sheet's `y`, so a notification landing
mid-drag would grow the sheet downward while making the same millimetre of
thumb worth less of it. `sheetHeight` is `dragging ? sheetFrozen : sheetTarget`
and both drag entry points go through one `beginDrag()` -- a condition stated
once rather than an assignment a third entry point could forget. Latched from
`sheetHeight`, not `sheetTarget`, so a growth caught mid-animation freezes at
what is on screen. Verified by clearing the list mid-drag: 630 held through
`dragging 92%` and `dragging 86%`, then settled to 330 on release.

**The sheet had to start clipping.** The height animates over 180ms and the
Column's `implicitHeight` does not -- it jumps the instant the model changes --
so for the length of a growth the content is taller than the box, and the new
card would paint on the scrim below the rounded edge. Axis-aligned and
unrotated, so this is a scissor rect rather than a stencil pass: one GL call,
which is the only reason it is affordable here. The corners are still a
rectangular clip against a 28px radius, so a card can peek into ~16px of
corner-bite for 180ms. Accepted; a true rounded clip is the off-screen pass
that ruled out theme previews.

**And the shade now reads its history twice on open.** `open()` archives the
live popups and then deferred the disk read by 250ms, which was invisible while
the sheet was a fixed height and is a 60px step 100ms after it settles now that
it is not. The immediate read decides the height before the open animation
starts; the deferred one still gets the contents right, because `clearPopups()`
archives through the service's own serialised queue.

**A check that could not have passed.** `moarchy-selftest` posts with
`notify-send`, and this image has no libnotify -- the same finding as 6p, one
caller over. H7 was posting into a `command not found`, swallowing it, and then
reporting the empty history as the swipe having failed. It would have blamed
the gesture. `post_note` goes through `omarchy-notification-send` now, which is
what exists here, and H7 passes for the first time on a stock image.

The new S21/S22 check reads a `shade sheet` IPC line rather than a capture:
`height=630 wanted=630 max=630 rows=8 listy=348 listmax=256 list=256
content=602 scrolls=1`. The second half is the part no screenshot could make --
now that the sheet clips, content that overflowed *into a scrolling list* and
content that fell off the bottom of the sheet look identical from outside.

## 6r. Twenty-eight controls and one of them answered (2026-09-07)

Every tappable thing in this shell drew the same picture whether a tap landed or
missed. Of the 34 `MouseArea`s, exactly one had a press state — `Device.qml`'s
back chevron, snapping between `container` and `"transparent"` with no fade — and
the file it lived in is the one that had already been caught claiming in a comment
to mirror screens it did not match. Everywhere else the only acknowledgement was
the consequence: a screen that changed, a radio that came up, an app that
launched. That is `style.md` §E's failure one step later. §E spends a section on
targets that are not the shape they look; this is a target that *is* the right
shape and still says nothing, and it had no rule to point at, which is how 33
controls shipped without one.

So §E got a companion. New §H, eight ACs, and §H/§I re-lettered to §I/§J to make
room. Two of the eight are readable from the source and are in
`scripts/style-check.sh` now — a control is a `MouseArea` that answers
`onClicked`, it must name itself and that name must reach a press state, or carry
a comment saying which of the four non-controls it is. Running it before writing
any QML printed the list: **28 controls, 26 of them silent**.

**Three things that look right and are not.** The first draft of the rule was
`Qt.tint(fill, alpha(ink, 0.12))`, which is elegant and wrong. Qt's tint lerps
`tint.rgb·a + base.rgb·(1−a)`, weighting the base's RGB *without* its alpha, so
over `"transparent"` — `#00000000`, which carries black — it returns 12% grey
rather than 12% ink. On a dark theme a press would have *darkened*, and only on
the controls that had no chrome, which is most of the interesting ones. It happens
to be right over `container` purely because base and tint share an RGB there. The
same arithmetic rules out `"transparent"` as the resting colour of the veil: a
`ColorAnimation` to it interpolates that black alongside the alpha, so the fade
detours through grey. Both ends are one ink at two alphas.

The second is the duration. A symmetric 120ms fade reaches 67% of the veil on an
80ms tap and peaks *after* the finger has left, because Qt restarts a `Behavior`
at its full duration from wherever the value is rather than shortening it — the
strongest frame of the acknowledgement is one nobody is touching. It wants to be
instant in and 120 out, and the obvious `enabled: !ma.pressed` cannot do it:
`enabled` and `color` are then two bindings on one notify signal, and QML runs
them in the order the notifier list was built, which is the reverse of the order
they are written. `enabled: veil.color.a > 0` sidesteps the question — a
`Behavior` reads `enabled` at the moment of the write, when the property still
holds the *old* colour, so it is false arriving and true leaving with nothing to
order against.

The third is that `MouseArea.pressed` stays true through a drag. On the shade and
the drawer the tiles *are* the sheet's drag handle, so an unguarded veil would
light every tile a scrolling thumb crossed. Inside a `Flickable` no guard is
needed — `QQuickMouseArea::ungrabMouse()` clears `pressed` before it emits
`canceled` — but the shade's own drag protocol only sets a flag, so those eight
bind `pressed && !root.sheetDragging`.

**Measured on glass.** The method that worked needs no accessor at all: `grim` a
frame with nothing pressed, another with `moarchy-touch hold` on the control, and
diff them — the bounding box of what changed *is* the highlight, so there is
nothing to ask the shell and nothing to confirm itself with. The gear answers over
44 and is drawn at 36; what changed was **72 × 73 panel px, 36 logical**, with the
pixel 4px outside the circle byte-identical. A settings row changed **336 × 58**
and the row above it did not change at all. The gear's rect is byte-identical
before the press and after it, so nothing is left lit — a check that only proves
the veil appears passes a stuck press state.

The drag guard took one gesture and a pixel count: **43** pixels of the pressed
fill with nothing pressed, **10,288** with the finger down and still inside the
10px slop, **4** once the drag latched.

**Two things this cost that are worth writing down.** The synthetic finger lands
**2.6s** after the command is launched — 2s of settle plus python and evdev
starting — and three captures were thrown away before that was measured rather
than assumed; a frame taken at 2.25s is a frame before the touch. And the
detector had to be re-derived once: a lit tile veils toward `textOnAccent`, which
is the dark background, so pressing an accent tile *darkens* it, and a pixel
constant taken from an unlit tile silently reads "nothing pressed" on a lit one.
Both failures looked exactly like the feature not working.

Installing found something else. `pacman -U` refused with eleven files that
"exist in filesystem" and are owned by no package — the Bluetooth plugin, eight
`moarchy-*` helpers and a desktop file, hand-copied onto the phone by an earlier
session. That is precisely what `structure.md` D2 rules out, and it had been
sitting there invisibly because nothing reinstalls a package it has already got.
`--overwrite` scoped to those three directories took ownership rather than
deleting anything, so they are package-owned now.

## 6s. Upstream 4.0.3 sandboxed us (2026-09-09)

Omarchy tagged v4.0.3 on 2026-09-08: 40 commits, 131 files. `port-4x.patch`
still applied to it cleanly, which is the answer that nearly ended the
investigation. The port was fine. The shell underneath it was not.

4.0.3 added 742 lines to `shell/shell.qml` implementing a capability-scoped
plugin sandbox. `pluginShellFor` used to hand every plugin the host `shell`;
now it hands third-party plugins a `PluginShellApi` that can summon, hide and
inspect only their **own** id, and that has no `panelLoaders`, no
`openPanelIds` and no `callIfLoaded` at all:

    function pluginShellFor(manifest) {
      if (!manifest || manifest.__isFirstParty) return shell
      return shell.createScopedPluginShell(manifest, key, true, ...)
    }

Our own patch scans `/usr/share/moarchy/plugins` with `scan_thirdparty`, so
all eleven `moarchy.*` plugins land on the scoped side. Reading what that
would actually cost, rather than assuming it was a widening of a sandbox we
did not use: `moarchy.gestures` reads `panelLoaders` at three sites to drive a
drag frame-by-frame and `openPanelIds` to know what a swipe should dismiss;
`moarchy.shade` gets its notifications and media from
`serviceFor("omarchy.notifications")` and `serviceFor("omarchy.media")`;
`moarchy.drawer` fills its grid from `appLibrary`, which the scoped surface
only populates for `kinds: ["menu"]` and the drawer is an `overlay`; and every
overlay hides `moarchy.shade` and `moarchy.drawer` by name before it opens.
Only `moarchy.bar` declares `kinds: ["bar"]`, so only it would have kept
cross-plugin control. The phone would have come up with a bar and nothing that
answers touch — the failure mode where every individual piece loads and logs
nothing.

**The fix is a trust boundary, not a capability grant.** `pluginIsTrusted()`
returns the host shell for `manifest.__isFirstParty` or an id under
`moarchy.`, used at `pluginShellFor`, `pluginRegistryFor` and
`pluginBarWidgetRegistryFor` — all three, because our plugins declare
`pluginRegistry` and `barWidgetRegistry` properties too and the first two gate
on the same flag. The rejected alternative was one word: scan our directory as
`scan_firstparty`. It costs the override. `PluginRegistry` refuses a
third-party id colliding with a first-party one — `plugin <id> rejected: id is
reserved for first-party Omarchy plugins` — so a `~/.config/omarchy/plugins`
copy of `moarchy.shade` would stop loading, and that copy is how this phone is
iterated on.

**The patch was regenerated, not appended to.** It has to apply with no offset
and no fuzz, so that a moved upstream fails the build rather than landing a
hunk somewhere it was never aimed at; three hunks had drifted to offsets
against 4.0.3. Regenerating and diffing old against new showed **zero lines
removed** from the nine existing hunks — the Sway port carried over untouched,
and the only addition is the `shell.qml` one. Ten files, 264 insertions, 33
deletions now.

**The menu grew 320 to 333**, all thirteen AI tooling, all classified
Unsupported on checkable grounds rather than on the assumption that new is
unsupported: `perplexity` and `t3code-bin` are `arch=('x86_64')` in the AUR;
`hermes-desktop` and `openclaw` do claim `aarch64`, but their installers end
in `setsid uwsm-app -- gtk-launch` and this image has no uwsm — sway starts
from `~/.bash_profile`. The four new agents are a `moarchy-agent` change, and
its list is still the same nine.

Which the selftest says out loud. **P5 is red and is meant to be**: "an agent
upstream adds must fail here, not arrive with no icon". It wants
`moarchy-agent`'s list, the `apps.default.agent` rows and
`/usr/share/moarchy/agents/*.svg` extended by four, and it stays red until
they are. The thirteen Unsupported rows record today's state, not the
intended one.

**Verified on the device, not just built.** 48 pass / 4 fail, unchanged in
shape from before the bump: phone shell 18/0, gesture plugin 3/0, drawer
geometry 2/0. `listPlugins` reports all eleven `moarchy.*` plugins with
`"firstParty":false`, so they are reaching the host shell through
`pluginIsTrusted` and nowhere else. Driven by synthesised touch: top-edge
swipe opens the shade, wallpaper drag opens the drawer, each hides the other,
the shade's notification list is populated and the drawer's grid is full —
which are exactly the six things the scoped surface would have returned `null`
or `false` for.

**A find along the way.** Upgrading `moarchy` 0.2.0 to 0.2.1 failed on
thirteen conflicting files, all unowned. Sweeping both moarchy trees turned up
**123 unowned files**: 104 macOS `._*` AppleDouble forks from an `scp` off a
Mac without `COPYFILE_DISABLE`, and 19 real ones — an earlier session's
hand-deployed copy of what became 0.2.1. Three of the nineteen are
`.desktop` files still sitting *inside* their plugin directories, which
0.2.1's PKGBUILD deliberately moves out; being unowned, the upgrade left them.
Backed up and resolved with `--overwrite`, not deleted. This is
§6g's problem with a new symptom: the tell was not a stale copy shadowing a
new one, it was pacman refusing to install over files nothing admitted to
owning.

## 6t. The theme picker had been pointing at a path that moved (2026-09-09)

Reported as "I cannot change themes anymore since at least yesterday". The
picker opened, the tiles drew, a tap highlighted one, and the header went to
"Applying..." and stayed there. Found still on screen mid-failure, with
Flexoki Light selected.

`omarchy-theme-set gruvbox` from a shell worked, exit 0, `theme.name` updated.
So the script was fine and the UI was not, and the shell's own log had been
saying why since the moment it broke:

    Process failed to start, likely because the binary could not be found.
    Command: QList("/usr/share/omarchy/bin/omarchy-theme-set", "Flexoki Light")

`moarchy.themes` built the command as `omarchyPath + "/bin/omarchy-theme-set"`,
and `OMARCHY_PATH` is `/usr/share/omarchy`. **`omarchy-config` installs
upstream's `bin/` into `/usr/bin` and never creates `$OMARCHY_PATH/bin` at
all.** The process could not be spawned, `pendingSlug` was never cleared, and
the header sat on "Applying..." forever. Quickshell reports this as a warning
and carries on, so nothing on screen said a word — §6f's shape again.

**The comment beside it was the reason it survived.** It read:

> Absolute path for the same reason the gestures plugin uses one: a shell
> started without the session environment has only `/usr/bin` on PATH, and the
> call would report success while nothing happened.

Which was true when it was written. `OMARCHY_PATH` was then the vendored
checkout at `~/.local/share/omarchy`, its `bin/` really did hold these
scripts, and `/usr/bin` really was the degraded case. Packaging inverted it on
2026-09-06: the scripts moved *to* `/usr/bin`, so the fallback the comment
feared became the only correct answer and the absolute path became the broken
one. The precedent it cites had evaporated too — `moarchy.gestures` still
declared `omarchyPath` but no longer used it for anything.

So: call it by name, which is what every other plugin does and what makes the
PKGBUILD's PATH-order shadowing work, `/usr/lib/moarchy/bin` coming before
`/usr/bin`. As argv rather than a `bash -lc` string, because theme display
names carry spaces. The dead `omarchyPath` property goes with it, and
`scripts/test-themes.sh` had the identical construction for
`omarchy-theme-set-templates` and is fixed alongside.

**The check that was already failing.** `omarchy-menu is missing from
/usr/share/omarchy/bin` has been red every selftest run, and §8 recorded it as
real but harmless because "nothing in the phone UI has needed it". That clause
was an assumption about who used the directory, not a search for who
referenced it — one `grep` for `/bin/` across the plugins would have found the
theme picker. It is the only runtime site in the repo that had it. §8 is
corrected.

Fixed, packaged and verified by tapping tiles on the device rather than by
calling the script: gruvbox to catppuccin-latte, then catppuccin-latte to
catppuccin, each applying visibly with no spawn failure in the log. Two
observations from doing it that way: the picker takes several seconds to paint
after `themes open` returns, so IPC reports `open` before anything is drawn
and a screenshot taken too early looks like the old bug; and applying a theme
resets the background to the theme's first, which is worth knowing before
blaming a wallpaper for changing on its own.

## 6u. The Pixel 3a booted, after a night spent measuring the wrong thing (2026-09-13/14)

The decisions are `docs/devices.md` D23–D26; this is what it cost to find them,
because the shape of the mistake is more reusable than the answers.

**The device cannot talk.** ABL replaces `console=` with `console=null` and
there is no pstore, so nothing before userspace is ever visible. A failing boot
and a working one are the same picture: two penguins, then silence. Nine images
were bisected against each other overnight — initramfs size, gzip vs zstd,
systemd vs busybox init, `autodetect` — and every one of them was mute for that
reason rather than for the reason under test.

**Three separate things were wrong, and each one hid the others.**

1. **`init=/init`.** ABL does not pass a cmdline through, it *builds* one, and
   its own `init=/init` goes in front of ours. An Arch rootfs has no `/init`,
   and a failed `init=` is a `panic()` with no fallback. Root had been mounting
   correctly the entire time; the kernel died one `execve` later.
2. **The A/B retry counter.** The bootloader counts down on every handoff and
   marks the slot unbootable at zero unless the OS calls back. By the time it
   read `slot-retry-count:a:0`, it was booting *nothing* — and the proof was
   that postmarketOS's own image, which had worked an hour earlier, failed
   identically. Every image tested after that point was "failing" for a reason
   that had nothing to do with the image.
3. **The initramfs itself**, which was the thing being blamed, and which turned
   out to be unnecessary — the kernel has ext4, mmc and GPT built in and
   resolves `root=PARTLABEL=` without help.

**What actually found them** was a shell, not a theory: `fastboot boot` the pmOS
image, telnet to 172.16.42.1:23, and read the running system. `/proc/cmdline`
showed the injected `init=/init` in one line. `blkid` showed the rootfs mounting
clean both `ro` and `rw`, which killed the filesystem-corruption theory before
any time went into it. `fastboot getvar all` showed the retry counter.

**Two traps that produced the same misleading silence**, worth writing down
because both look exactly like "init never ran": a hand-built initramfs
containing a *dynamically linked* busybox with no libc and no loader cannot be
`exec`'d at all; and `exec >/dev/tty0 2>&1` **exits the shell** when the node is
missing, which is why pmOS `tee`s instead.

**The rule this leaves behind.** On a device with no console, a boot that
produces no output is not evidence about the thing you changed. Establish a
channel first — and check `fastboot getvar slot-unbootable:a` before believing
any A/B result at all, because that one silently invalidates every measurement
taken after it flips.

## 6v. A tile that was never drawn, and a GPS that never speaks (2026-09-15)

Two questions asked of the Pixel 3a — *does the torch work, does GPS work* —
and both answers turned out to be about something reporting success.

**The torch.** The tile was not off, it was **absent**: three small tiles
instead of four. The shade probes with `[ -w …/brightness ]` and hides a
control it cannot operate, which is the right behaviour and is
indistinguishable on screen from a phone with no flash LED. The LED is real
and lights on a root write.

What was wrong is a path. `feedbackd` ships `72-feedbackd.rules`, which matches
`*/*:flash` and delegates the permission to `/usr/libexec/fbd-ledctrl`; Arch
installs that helper at `/usr/lib/fbd-ledctrl`. udev logs `Failed to find and
pin callout binary … ignoring` and moves on, so the attribute keeps
`root:root 0644` on every boot. `moarchy-firstboot`'s `usermod -aG feedbackd`
was doing its job the whole time against a group that had been granted nothing.

`moarchy-led-perms.service` re-triggers LED rules at boot and was running — it
simply re-ran the same rule and got the same failure two seconds later, which
is why the journal carries the message twice. A service that works, re-running
a rule that does not.

The fix is `73-moarchy-torch.rules` in the `moarchy` package (docs/shade.md
S10a): ours, device-independent, doing the chgrp and chmod itself. Not a
symlink into feedbackd's layout — that had to be typed on a phone somebody
would eventually reflash, and it would break again the next time feedbackd
moved the file. `GROUP=`/`MODE=` cannot express it: udev applies those to the
node in `/dev`, and an LED has none.

S10 was amended in the same change, because it had said the tile is absent
"when the device has no flash LED" and the code has always tested writability.
The spec described one of the two causes and the missing one was the bug.

**GPS is a longer story and is not fixed.** Every layer reports success: the
QMI Location service is registered on qrtr, `rmtfs` and `tqftpserv` run,
ModemManager advertises `gps-raw, gps-nmea, agps-msa, agps-msb`, and enabling
location gathering answers "successfully setup location gathering". Two things
are nonetheless true. The GNSS engine ships **locked** — `qmicli
--loc-get-engine-lock` returns `all`, both MI and MT blocked — and once
unlocked, only Qualcomm's proprietary `$PQW*` sentences ever arrive. MM logs
`couldn't setup required NMEA traces: Operation timed out`, `--location-get`
holds not one `GGA`/`RMC`/`GSV` line, and `--loc-get-position-report` from a
fresh client times out.

The engine is *solving*: `$PQWP1`/`$PQWP2` carry latitude and longitude in
**radians**, and over a few minutes indoors their uncertainty field fell from
~256 km to ~11 m at a plausible position. So "no fix" was the wrong summary.
The right one is that the fix never leaves the modem in a form anything can
read, which means geoclue has nothing and no app can have a position. Left
open; the engine lock is the half worth remembering, because it makes every
measurement taken before it is checked meaningless.

## 6w. Upstream 4.0.4 was a kernel release (2026-09-17)

Omarchy tagged v4.0.4 on 2026-09-14 (`c668141`): six commits, sixteen files,
all of them about the x86 kernel. Desktops move to `linux-omarchy` except on T2
Macs, and every DKMS driver install now takes the matching headers as a base
system guarantee rather than naming `linux-headers` itself.

**Nothing under `shell/`, `config/`, `default/`, `themes/` or `applications/`
changed**, and none of the eleven files the two patches name, so both applied
at zero offset with no `.orig`, and §A2's Hyprland grep stayed empty. That is
upstream.md §A's first real bump, and its guards had nothing to catch.

The package was then diffed against the 4.0.3-5 artifact rather than trusted
on a green build, because "the patch applied" answers nothing about what else
moved. Beyond `.PKGINFO` and friends, exactly ten files differ, and they are
upstream's own diff restricted to what `package()` copies:
`omarchy-install-gaming-xbox-controllers`, five `install/hardware/` scripts
(`intel/ptl-kernel.sh` deleted), `install/omarchy-other.packages`, and two new
migrations. None of them is reachable on the phone:

- Both migrations are inert on aarch64. `1789325478` installs `linux-omarchy`
  and rewrites Limine's boot order, and exits at
  `[[ $(uname -m) == "x86_64" ]] || exit 0` before doing either. `1789444024`
  adds headers only for a `linux-omarchy` or `linux-t2` that is present.
  Nothing here would run them anyway. `omarchy-migrate`'s callers are
  `omarchy-update` (`update.omarchy`, Unsupported), `omarchy-upgrade-to-quattro`
  and `omarchy-migrate-notify`, and the notifier's unit ships under
  `/usr/share/omarchy/default/systemd/user`, a directory systemd does not read.
  Nothing in this repo calls or enables any of them.
- `install.gaming.xbox-controllers` is Unsupported in `menu-coverage.md`.
- `install/hardware/all.sh` is sourced by `omarchy-apply-hardware`, which is
  upstream's ISO finalisation step: it refuses to run without root and
  `--install-user`, and the only thing that invokes it is
  `omarchy-apply-system`, which nothing invokes. The directory is shipped for
  `install/helpers/`, not for this.

§D1 re-measured: 444 scripts in `bin/`, 75 that name Hyprland, both unchanged.
The menu is still 333 entries, since `omarchy-menu.jsonc` did not move.
`omarchy-config` goes to 4.0.4-1. pkgrel resets with pkgver, and everything
4.0.3-2 through -5 carried is still in the patches and `package()`.

Not verified on either device, deliberately: the shell a phone runs from this
package is byte-identical to 4.0.3-5's, so a device run would test the previous
build again. The url still says `basecamp/omarchy` and still reaches
`omacom/omarchy` by a 301; upstream.md's constraint about that is unchanged.

## 6x. One surface for what is running (2026-09-18)

The drawer had a shelf of open apps across its top and the overview had a card
per workspace, and both were answering "what is running". The shelf went, with
its twelve criteria (§M), and what it could do that the overview could not --
close a window -- went to the overview as a bin.

**The shelf's own axis problem went with it.** A tile inside the grid's header
had three claimants for a vertical drag: the row paged sideways, the grid
scrolled, and the tile flicked away. It arbitrated by hand -- `preventStealing`
flipped on the first 3px of dominant travel -- and §8's first open defect was a
downward flick that stopped closing the drawer in exactly the horizontal band
that row occupies. `refactor.md` H4 had named that arbitration and left it.

**The lift stopped being claimed by time.** A hold was the only axis left when
a window had to be able to travel up and down to reach a card and rightward
belonged to the sheet. A bin is a place rather than a direction, so the lift is
now the ordinary claim every other gesture here makes -- travel past
`dragSlop` -- and the tile takes the grab from the press instead of racing the
Flickable's own threshold for it. The 500ms that made drag-and-drop feel like a
wait is gone rather than shortened; the drawer's hold (L1) keeps the number,
and there is still one hold on this phone.

**What a close is, and is not.** A drop in the bin dispatches
`[con_id=N] kill`, which is sway's name for `xdg_toplevel.close` -- a request,
so an editor with unsaved work prompts. By con_id and not through the
foreign-toplevel handle, which is matched on app id and title and is ambiguous
for two terminals and for every one of this shell's own screens.

Five IPC verbs moved or arrived with it. `drawer openApps` became
`overview windows` -- read from `ToplevelManager` rather than from the board,
so it still answers with the sheet shut, which is the state K1, K4, K5 and K6
all ask it in -- and `lifted`, `aim`, `trash`, `binTarget` and `tileTarget` are
what make P4, P6, P12 and P13 runnable. P4 gained the finger check the shelf's
tap had (`activate()` is a no-op on this compositor, and a tap driven from the
app it names cannot see that); the M block became a P block that drives the
same three gestures on the other surface.

**Then the phone refuted one line of it.** Installed as 0.4.0-2 on the Pixel
3a, the IPC half came out exactly as written -- `drawer openApps` gone,
`overview windows` answering with the sheet shut, `binTarget` going
`drawn=false` to `drawn=true` across a lift, `aim` into the band flipping
`lifted` from `over 1` to `over bin`, `trash` closing a window and `tileTarget`
answering `no tile` before the app had -- but a `grim` of the lit bin showed it
sitting on top of the free-workspace card, whose label was the only part of it
left visible. The argument for overlaying the band (cards are short, the phone
has few workspaces) was written on this host and was wrong on a phone with six
of them, which is an ordinary number. The band is reserved off the list now and
the bin covers nothing; the list pays a card's height for it at all times.

`scripts/style-check.sh` passes at 17/17. `bin/moarchy-selftest --gestures` has
not run: it drives real touch, and the device was in use. The screenshots in
`README.md` still show the shelf until they are retaken.

## 6y. The rocker had no picture (2026-09-19)

Pressing the volume keys changed the volume and drew nothing. The binding went
straight to `wpctl`, under a comment saying the shell watches PipeWire and puts
an overlay up by itself. It does not: upstream's OSD is *told*, over IPC, by
each command that changes something, and on this phone the only command that
ever told it was `omarchy-brightness-display`. So the one hardware control the
device really has was the one with no feedback -- and a sink already at 100%
takes a `5%+` and stays put, which is the state §6x's speaker work was reported
from as "the rocker is broken".

**The wiring is inverted from upstream's, and that is the part worth keeping.**
`moarchy-volume` moves the sink and stops; `moarchy.volume` binds the sink and
raises itself when what it is bound to changes. Nothing has to remember to
announce anything, so the shade's slider, `wpctl` over ssh and an Android app
under Waydroid all raise the same panel -- and the rocker still works with the
shell down or too busy to answer, which is the failure a told panel would hand
to the one control that must not have it. The cost is one latch: a sink
publishes its volume as it binds, so changes are ignored for 800ms after the
audio object changes identity, or the phone greets you with a volume panel at
login.

**The phone agreed with the arithmetic and refuted two checks.** `volume
geometry` came back `card=288,248 56x244 track=294,254 44x180 mute=294,442
44x44 margin=16 screen=360x740`, which is the layout table evaluated by hand,
and a real `KEY_VOLUMEUP` through `/dev/uinput` moved the sink 0.40 to 0.45 and
opened the panel -- the whole chain, not an IPC shortcut standing in for the
binding.

The two that were wrong were both checks, and both were green for a bad reason
first:

- **`visible` is inherited.** `volume level` reported `fill=` off
  `fill.visible`, which reads false whenever the *window* is down -- so the
  report said the track was empty at every volume, and V5, which reads it from
  a closed panel, would have passed on a fill bound to nothing. It reads the
  level now.
- **A sleep measured the load.** V6 set a level, slept 0.5s and read the glyph.
  The shell learns about a volume change through PipeWire on its own event
  loop, and with Waydroid running that lands later than that: the check read
  the *previous* level's glyph and called it a colour. It waits for the panel
  and the sink to agree now. The ladder it was accusing was correct at every
  level.

**The glyphs were settled off the font, not off their names.** The four are not
adjacent -- F057F is a bare cone, F0580 one wave, F057E two, F075F the crossed
speaker -- and the codepoints either side of them are a knot and a walking man.
Rendered out of the phone's own JetBrainsMono Nerd Font rather than inferred,
which is Android's own four-state ladder.

**One failure was a neighbour, not a bug.** V12 (no panel over an open shade)
failed once, on a phone where another session had the shade open and then took
it away mid-run. Both ways of opening the shade suppress correctly; the check
now runs on a device nobody else is driving. It is the third time this quarter
that a shared device has produced a red line with a local explanation.

The panel draws square on this phone because `ui.toml` says `corners =
"square"`, which is the chrome file working rather than a missing radius.

## 7. Hardware status

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Display, touch, wifi, bluetooth | working |
| Audio **output** | working — sink present, streams play |
| **Microphone** | **not working** — records digital silence (RMS 0) at PipeWire *and* raw ALSA, despite `Mic1` on, boost 7, `ADC` 144/192 and `AIF1 Slot 0 Digital ADC` on |
| **Camera** | **working as of 2026-09-06** via Megapixels 2.1.0 — `libmegapixels` configures the media graph, which nothing else was doing. Reboots the phone on the first launch after a boot; undiagnosed. See `docs/apps.md` |

## 8. Known-bad / open

- ~~**A downward flick starting on the open-apps shelf does not close the
  drawer.**~~ **Gone with the row, 2026-09-18** (§6x): the drawer has no shelf,
  so it has no band that behaves differently. It was never root-caused, and the
  hypothesis it died with is the one thing worth keeping — a control that
  decides who owns a gesture over the first few frames starves an
  interval-based speed reading of its early samples, and the tile it named was
  the only control on that sheet still doing it. The overview's tile, which
  inherited the gesture, claims the grab on the press instead (P6).

- ~~**The drawer's shelf does not answer a synthetic touch.**~~ **Root-caused
  2026-09-15, and it was the check.** M5, M6, L1 and L3 aimed their touches by
  multiplying a surface coordinate by sway's **output scale** (`3.0` here), and
  `bin/moarchy-touch` declares a panel of its own — 720x1440 against a 360x740
  logical output, so the factor is **2**. The output's scale is the HiDPI ratio
  between logical and physical pixels (1080x2220): a different number about a
  different thing.

  M6's flick therefore landed 171 logical px below the tile it named, on the
  app grid, and the shelf appeared not to answer a flick at all — on this build
  and on the packaged 0.2.2-4 alike, which is what an A/B established before
  anyone looked at the arithmetic. Aimed by the injector's own ratio, the same
  flick closes the app: 2 windows to 1.

  Three other checks in the same file already derived it as `720 / lw` and
  passed throughout, which is the tell. It is now derived once, near `STRIP_Y`,
  read out of `moarchy-touch` itself so the two cannot drift.

- **Compositor renders only the background layer** in some states: sway tracks
  windows and the bar reserves its exclusive zone (`foot y=27`), but nothing above
  swaybg paints. First seen after running a browser; a reboot cleared it once,
  then it recurred and persisted. Not root-caused.
- `HyprlandFocusGrab` stubbed out — menus do not dismiss on tap-outside. The
  back gesture now reaches them: `moarchy.gestures` walks the host's
  `openPanelIds` for `omarchy.` surfaces after its own, so a vendored popup can
  at least be dismissed. Tapping outside one still does nothing.
- `I3.workspaces` shape differs from Hyprland's in ways not fully explored.
- **Two selftest base checks can never pass on this phone.**
  `screen-keyboard-enabled is false` and `no input source is configured` gate
  *squeekboard*, and the keyboard that owns `sm.puri.OSK0` here is
  `moarchy-keyboard`. They ask for gsettings nothing on this image reads, so
  they are red every run and cannot go green — the same fault G5 had before
  it learned to skip. They should skip when the running keyboard does not need
  them, rather than fail. `omarchy-menu is missing from /usr/share/omarchy/bin`
  is the third standing base failure and is real: the file genuinely is not
  there, because `omarchy-config` packages upstream's `bin/` into `/usr/bin`
  and never creates `$OMARCHY_PATH/bin` at all.
  ~~and nothing in the phone UI has needed it since the menu stopped being how
  Settings is reached.~~ **That last clause was wrong, and it cost a day.**
  `moarchy.themes` built its command as `omarchyPath + "/bin/omarchy-theme-set"`,
  so the theme picker spawned a path that does not exist and sat on
  "Applying..." forever -- reported 2026-09-09 as "I cannot change themes
  anymore". The shell log said so plainly the whole time:

      Process failed to start, likely because the binary could not be found.
      Command: QList("/usr/share/omarchy/bin/omarchy-theme-set", "Flexoki Light")

  Fixed by calling `omarchy-theme-set` by name, which is what every other
  plugin does and what makes the PKGBUILD's PATH-order shadowing work.
  `scripts/test-themes.sh` had the same construction and is fixed with it.
  The lesson is the standing failure itself: this check was pointing at a
  real broken path, and it was filed as harmless on an assumption about what
  needed the directory rather than on a search for who referenced it.
- ~~**The on-screen keyboard was drawn over Settings with no field focused.**~~
  **Explained 2026-09-07**, by the screenshot bug below: satty maps a window
  that never paints, that window takes focus, and the OSK rises to meet it. What
  looked like a keyboard appearing over Settings for no reason was a keyboard
  appearing over an application you cannot see. The invisible window is what
  needed finding, not the keyboard.
- **The camera reboots the phone on first launch.** It works on the second
  attempt and every time after. Undiagnosed: the candidates are OOM under a
  software-rendered 2592x1944 preview on 2 GB, a power brownout from the
  `sgm3140` flash LED, or a `sun6i-csi` fault on first pipeline setup. All three
  fit "worked after a reboot" and have completely different fixes. The image
  keeps `/var/log/journal` now, so `journalctl -b -1` will say which.

- **`bin/moarchy-selftest`'s three standing base failures**, above, are the
  ones to fix or teach to skip; nothing else in this list is red every run.

- ~~**Browser-policy theming fails on every `omarchy-theme-set`.**~~ **Fixed
  2026-09-06** by packaging: the error was that `omarchy-theme-set-browser`
  sources `$OMARCHY_PATH/install/helpers/browser-policy.sh`, and we shipped a
  checkout with `install/` excluded. `omarchy-config` ships it now.
  Historical description follows.

- **Browser-policy theming fails on every `omarchy-theme-set`.** Upstream's
  `omarchy-theme-set-browser-policy` runs its privileged half from
  `/usr/bin/...` because that is the path `/etc/sudoers.d/omarchy-theme-browser`
  names, and we vendor a checkout rather than installing the package, so nothing
  is there: `Error accessing /usr/bin/omarchy-theme-set-browser-policy`. The
  caller sets `failed=1` and carries on, so only Chromium's managed-policy
  colour is lost. Harmless, but it prints on every theme change and looks like a
  real failure.

*(That last sentence used to read "The v3.8.4 (waybar-based) port on `main` ran
stably for hours and is the fallback." It is not a fallback and it is not on
`main`: the 3.8.4 port was deleted when 4.x shipped and exists only in git
history. See the README's Omarchy 4.x section.)*
