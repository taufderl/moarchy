# Omarchy menu coverage

Which of Omarchy 4.0.4's menu entries the phone supports, which it adapts, and
which it drops. This file is the *record*; `docs/settings.md` is the contract the
Settings UI is built to, and `bin/moarchy-selftest --settings` checks both
against the code.

Upstream ships **333 entries** in `default/omarchy/omarchy-menu.jsonc`, pinned at
v4.0.4 (`c668141e`). Every one of them appears below exactly once.
v4.0.4 did not touch that file, or anything under `shell/`, so the table
carried over from v4.0.3 unchanged.

v4.0.3 added thirteen, all of them AI tooling: four agents for the default-agent
radio, four Install > AI apps, and the `remove.ai` container with its four
children. All thirteen land Unsupported. Two of the packages are `x86_64` in the
AUR outright; the two that do claim `aarch64` are unverified here and their
installers open the app with `uwsm-app`, which this image does not carry. The
four agents are a `moarchy-agent` change rather than an upstream one -- its
list is the same nine it was before the bump.

## How to read this

| Class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Native** | Reimplemented as a phone control or screen. moarchy code, not Omarchy's. Container rows that become one of our screens are Native too -- nothing of upstream's runs. |
| **Bridged** | Upstream's own script runs unchanged; only the way it is launched changes -- a tiled TUI-sized terminal instead of a floating one, epiphany instead of a Chromium web app. |
| **Control Center** | Already a control in the pull-down control center. Deliberately not repeated in Settings. |
| **Unsupported** | Hidden from the UI. The reason names the missing binary, the x86_64 constraint, or the Hyprland dependency. |

Two rules decide the hard cases.

**A package that is aarch64-verified but not installed by default is Bridged,
not Unsupported.** That set used to be a file, `moarchy-extras.packages`; since
M2 deleted both `.packages` files (`docs/structure.md` P6) it is the commented
"Not installed by default" block at the foot of
`pkgbuilds/moarchy-meta/PKGBUILD`. The row gets a
`when: omarchy-cmd-present <bin>` guard and appears once the user installs it.
"Not installed" is not "impossible". Genuine hardware blocks stay Unsupported --
today that is the microphone, which records digital silence at PipeWire and at
raw ALSA. It is no longer the camera: Megapixels 2.1.0 streams both sensors as
of 2026-09-06 (`docs/apps.md`), so any row still resting on `VIDIOC_STREAMON`
is resting on a diagnosis that was wrong.

**Bridged means the command is untouched.** 128 of the 320 rows are
`omarchy-launch-floating-terminal-with-presentation <script>`, and every
`omarchy-*` script they name exists upstream. Because `bin/` here shadows
`$OMARCHY_PATH/bin` by PATH order, one shim for that wrapper -- routing to
`moarchy-launch-tui`, a foot at font size 7 -- makes the whole class work
without reimplementing any of it. Of the 58 Bridged rows, all but four run a
command byte-identical to upstream's `action`; `docs/settings.md` E2 names the
four and the selftest diffs them statically.

That terminal is a normal tiled window. It was fullscreened until 2026-09-06,
which made every row that asks a question unanswerable: sway draws a fullscreen
view above the Top layer, the keyboard is a Top-layer surface, so the prompt
appeared and the keys did not.

## Totals

| Class | Entries |
| --- | ---: |
| Native | 69 |
| Bridged | 58 |
| Control Center | 1 |
| Unsupported | 205 |
| **Total** | **333** |

Roughly a third of the menu survives. That is not a gap to be closed: the
dropped two thirds are Steam and Battle.net, twenty language runtimes behind
`mise`, six desktop browsers with no aarch64 build, and Hyprland's own
configuration files.

Four rows in the tree carry no upstream id at all and so appear in none of
these numbers: **Wi-Fi networks**, **Bluetooth devices**, **Update system** and
**Authorize SSH keys**. The last shares `setup.security.sshd` with the Remote
access switch, which already claims it, and exists because that switch reads
`systemctl is-enabled sshd` and so goes inert once the daemon is on.
**Update system** is not `update.omarchy` renamed -- that id stays Unsupported
for the reason its row below gives, and this one runs `sudo pacman -Syu`, which
`docs/structure.md` R8a says works on this image and cannot move the frozen
device stack. `docs/settings.md` records why claiming the id would be a
promise the row does not keep.

Where an entry lands is written with `>` for one level down, e.g.
`Appearance > Status bar > Battery percentage`. A container row that dissolves
into several screens says so.

## Root (2)

Native 1 · Bridged 1

The two root entries that are not the head of a route of their own.

| id | label | class | lands at | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apps` | Apps | Native | App drawer | the app drawer is the `apps` provider; not repeated in Settings |
| `about` | About | Native | About phone > About Omarchy | a page of rows; `omarchy-launch-about` re-execs through the default terminal with `--render`, which qmlkonsole refused. foot is the default since 2026-09-08, but the page stays rows -- fastfetch re-measuring itself on every resize is wrong in a 47-column window whichever terminal draws it |

| `system` | System | Native | System > Power | also the control center's power glyph target |
| `system.screensaver` | Screensaver | Unsupported | -- | `omarchy-launch-screensaver` exits 1 unless `ttfx` is present, and ttfx has no aarch64 build in any repo here; it failed silently, which looked like a screensaver that ran |
| `system.lock` | Lock | Native | System > Power > Lock | `moarchy-system-lock`; blanks unless a hardware keyboard is present |
| `system.suspend` | Suspend | Unsupported | -- | suspending locks the session: the session starts sway-session.target (config/sway/config, the target itself shipped by pkgbuilds/moarchy; install/config.sh started it until 2026-09-06), which brings up 4.x's omarchy-sleep-lock unit, and the lock it raises is an ext-session-lock surface -- so the on-screen keyboard is hidden by the very prompt asking for a password. Same trap idle-lock was disabled for. Locked a phone out on 2026-09-05 |
| `system.hibernate` | Hibernate | Unsupported | -- | `omarchy-hibernation-available` tests for swap; the SD root has no resume device or RAM-sized swap |
| `system.logout` | Logout | Native | System > Power > Log out | needs a new `moarchy-system-logout` (`swaymsg exit`); upstream's exits Hyprland |
| `system.reboot` | Reboot | Bridged | System > Power > Restart |  |

## Update (28)

Native 6 · Bridged 8 · Unsupported 14

| id | label | class | lands at | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `update` | Update | Native | dissolved: System, Shell & plugins |  |
| `update.omarchy` | Omarchy | Unsupported | -- | `omarchy-update` needs the `omarchy` package (absent from pkgs.omarchy.org's aarch64 app catalog) and Snapper on btrfs |
| `update.channel` | Channel | Unsupported | -- | every child unsupported |
| `update.config` | Config | Native | Shell & plugins | only Tmux survives |
| `update.themes` | Extra Themes | Bridged | Appearance > Get more | upstream `when: omarchy-theme-extras` kept |
| `update.process` | Process | Native | Shell & plugins | only Shell survives |
| `update.hardware` | Hardware | Native | System > Restart hardware |  |
| `update.firmware` | Firmware | Unsupported | -- | fwupd is not installed and a phone has no UEFI capsule path |
| `update.password` | Password | Native | dissolved: Security | only the user password survives |
| `update.timezone` | Timezone | Native | System > Date & time | region then city, two provider pages; the select box was a filter field over ~420 entries |
| `update.time` | Time | Bridged | System > Date & time |  |
| `update.channel.stable` | Stable | Unsupported | -- | a channel switch moves the vendored checkout off the pinned v4.0.4 that `pkgbuilds/omarchy-config/port-4x.patch` applies against |
| `update.channel.rc` | RC | Unsupported | -- | as `update.channel.stable` |
| `update.channel.edge` | Edge | Unsupported | -- | as `update.channel.stable` |
| `update.channel.dev` | Dev | Unsupported | -- | as `update.channel.stable` |
| `update.process.hyprsunset` | Hyprsunset | Unsupported | -- | hyprsunset is Hyprland-only |
| `update.process.shell` | Shell | Native | Shell & plugins > Restart shell | `moarchy-restart-shell` shadows `omarchy-restart-shell` on PATH |
| `update.config.hyprland` | Hyprland | Unsupported | -- | Hyprland cannot run here |
| `update.config.hyprsunset` | Hyprsunset | Unsupported | -- | hyprsunset is Hyprland-only |
| `update.config.plymouth` | Plymouth | Unsupported | -- | plymouth is not installed |
| `update.config.tmux` | Tmux | Bridged | Shell & plugins > Reset tmux config | tmux is installed |
| `update.config.shell` | Shell | Unsupported | -- | `omarchy-refresh-shell` rewrites shell.json from Omarchy's defaults, dropping `bar.id` and every moarchy.* plugin -- it succeeds, then restarts into the desktop bar with no app drawer, control center or gestures |
| `update.hardware.audio` | Audio | Bridged | System > Restart hardware |  |
| `update.hardware.wifi` | Wi-Fi | Bridged | System > Restart hardware |  |
| `update.hardware.bluetooth` | Bluetooth | Bridged | System > Restart hardware |  |
| `update.hardware.trackpad` | Trackpad | Unsupported | -- | no touchpad; `omarchy-restart-trackpad` reloads Hyprland input |
| `update.password.drive` | Drive Encryption | Unsupported | -- | the SD/eMMC root is not LUKS, so cryptsetup has no volume to re-key |
| `update.password.user` | User | Bridged | Security > Change password | `sudo passwd "$USER"` in a TUI -- an E2 exception. The account ships with a *locked* password, so upstream's bare `passwd` has nothing to authenticate against and fails on its first question; under sudo it sets one outright |

---

## Keeping it honest

The table drifts the moment a row moves, so it is checked rather than trusted.
`Pages.js` emits its own coverage map over IPC, and the selftest diffs that three
ways: against this file, against the upstream JSONC (every id, exactly once), and
against the rendered rows (nothing classified Unsupported is reachable).

```
omarchy-shell settings coverage | cut -f1 | sort
```

See `docs/settings.md` section G for the acceptance criteria this satisfies.
