# Upstream boundary — specification

What has to be true for bumping `[omarchy]` in `manifest.toml` to be a safe
operation. [structure.md](structure.md) says the pin is the only supported way
to change what an image contains (V5); it does not say what has to hold when
the pin moves. This file is that.

Present tense, normative. The archaeology lives in
[build-log.md](build-log.md); the shape of our own code is
[refactor.md](refactor.md); this is the contract at the seam between the two.

**Override note (2026-09-29): the Sway port described in this file was removed.**
This fork now runs Hyprland; `port-4x.patch` no longer performs the
Hyprland-to-Sway translation (it keeps upstream's `Quickshell.Hyprland` and only
hosts our plugins). See the README's "Compositor and upstream divergence"
section and `omarchy-config`'s change 3. Passages below that still describe the
Sway port as current are pre-Hyprland; treat this note as the override until they
are rewritten.

Status: **§A landed 2026-09-13.** §B–§E are the contract to argue with before
any of them is; where an AC is my reading rather than a decision it is marked
**?**.

## Why this file exists

The port was moved from `install/port-4x.sh` to `port-4x.patch` on 2026-09-06,
and `pkgbuilds/omarchy-config/PKGBUILD` records the reason: a sed pass against
a moved upstream "matches nothing and ships a shell that still imports
`Quickshell.Hyprland`, which is a failure this project has paid for before."
The patch was supposed to close that.

**Measured 2026-09-13, against upstream's current default branch.** `quattro`
is 363 commits ahead of the pin (and 103 behind — the branches have diverged).
Applied in the builder's own toolchain, GNU patch 2.8 on `linux/arm64`
(`menci/archlinuxarm:base-devel`):

```
patching file shell/plugins/bar/widgets/KeyboardLayout.qml
Hunk #2 succeeded at 102 (offset 19 lines).
patching file shell/plugins/menu/Menu.qml
Hunk #3 succeeded at 1282 (offset 48 lines).
patching file shell/shell.qml
Hunk #1 succeeded at 721 (offset -15 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 784 (offset -15 lines).
EXIT=0
```

The build succeeds. What it produces is a half-ported shell:

```
shell/plugins/background/Background.qml:2   import Quickshell.Hyprland
shell/plugins/background/Background.qml:236 Hyprland.monitorFor(modelData)
```

`Background.qml` did not exist at the pin, so the patch was never aimed at it,
so it applies cleanly and the wallpaper plugin ships unported. The same run
leaves `shell.qml.orig`, `Menu.qml.orig` and `KeyboardLayout.qml.orig` in the
tree, which `package()`'s `cp -a shell` would install.

The control is clean: the same patch against the pinned v4.0.3 tree reports no
offsets and leaves no `.orig`.

Two separate defects, both silent:

1. **`--fuzz=0` does not mean "no offset".** It bounds fuzz — how many context
   lines may mismatch. Offsets are always permitted, reported on stdout, and
   `patch` exits 0 either way. The PKGBUILD header's claim that a hunk "must
   apply with no offset and no fuzz, so a moved upstream fails the build" is
   not a property the build has.
2. **A patch can only assert about files it names.** Completeness of the port
   is a property of the whole tree, and nothing measures it.

Neither is an argument against the patch. The patch is doing its job — it is
the *only* thing here that can fail loudly at all, and it applied across 363
commits of drift without a reject. The gap is that "applied" was being read as
"ported", and those are different claims.

## Vocabulary

| Term | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **the pin** | `[omarchy]` in `manifest.toml`: url, ref, version. Moving it is a bump. |
| **the port** | `port-4x.patch`: hosts moarchy's plugins in the vendored shell. It once also translated the compositor from Hyprland to Sway; that half was removed when the fork moved to Hyprland. It will never go upstream. |
| **a carried change** | A change to upstream's tree that is *not* the port — config, a feature, or how our plugins are hosted. Each one has its own reason to exist and its own way of ending. |
| **the seam** | Everything that couples us to upstream: the patch, the `bin/` shims, the `shell.*` API the plugins call, and the theme template directory. |
| **loud** | A failure that stops the build or fails a check by name. The opposite is what §A is about. |

---

## A. A moved upstream fails the build

*Landed 2026-09-13.*

**A1** A hunk that applies at a non-zero offset fails the build. GNU patch has
no flag for this; what it does have is `--backup-if-mismatch`, on by default,
which writes a `.orig` for exactly the files that did not apply cleanly. So the
signal already exists and is merely unread: `prepare()` fails if any `.orig` or
`.rej` survives it.
→ Verified in both directions on 2026-09-13: fails against `quattro`
(three `.orig`), passes against the pin (none).

**A2** The port is complete or the build fails. After both patches,
no file under `shell/` matches `Quickshell\.Hyprland` or `\bHyprland\.`.
This is the assertion a patch structurally cannot make, and it is the one that
catches the case §A's measurement found — a *new* upstream file with a
Hyprland import in it.
→ Fails against `quattro` (`Background.qml`), passes against the pin.

**A3** No `.orig` or `.rej` reaches a package. A1 makes this automatic — the
build is already dead by then — and it is written down separately because the
two failures are independent: A1 is about whether the port is right, this is
about what `cp -a` sweeps up. It is the same class as
[[packages-dir-accumulates]] and [[stage-by-explicit-path]]: a wildcard that
takes whatever is in the directory.

**A4** The guards live in `prepare()`, next to the patches, not in a script a
bump is expected to remember to run. `makepkg` is the one thing that always
runs. **?** — the alternative is `scripts/` and a line in the bump procedure,
which is the arrangement that has already failed once for the keyboard's pkgrel
([[manifest.toml]] `[moarchy-keyboard]`).

---

## B. The patch is split by lifetime

One file mixes five changes that expire for five different reasons, so a bump
that breaks any of them breaks "the patch" and tells you nothing further. Split,
each failure names its own kind.

**Measured 2026-09-13**, `port-4x.patch`, 10 files, +242/−33:

| Concern | Files | Size | Ends when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The port | `PopupCard`, `Bar`, `KeyboardLayout`, `Workspaces`, `idle/Service` | +36/−21 | Never |
| Shell config | `config/omarchy/shell.json` | +36/−4 | Upstream reads a second config path |
| Launch feedback | `services/AppLibrary.qml` | +21/−3 | The splash moves out of upstream's launch path |
| Plugin hosting | `PluginRegistry`, `shell.qml` | +43/−4 | Upstream ships a system plugin dir and a trust model |
| The menu back button | `plugins/menu/Menu.qml` | +106/−1 | It lands upstream (§C1) |

**B1** Each row is its own `.patch`, applied in order, named for what it is:
`10-port.patch`, `20-shell-config.patch`, `30-launch-feedback.patch`,
`40-plugin-hosting.patch`, `50-menu-back-button.patch`. The
`notification-popups-bar-opt-out.patch` already sets this pattern and its
PKGBUILD comment already gives the reason — "it is MEANT to go upstream and be
deleted here once it lands" — which is a statement no hunk inside `port-4x.patch`
can make about itself.

**B2** `structure.md` Q5's fork test is measured per concern as well as in
total. The total is what Q5 asks for; the split is what says *where* it grew.
Q5 measured 9 files, +230/−30 on 2026-09-07 and it is 10 files, +242/−33 six
days later — still inside "a few hundred lines", and the growth is one new file
(`shell.qml`) in the hosting row.

**B3** The port row stays mechanical. Four of its five files change only an
import and an identifier; `Workspaces.qml` (+27/−9) is the one that carries
real semantics — sway's workspace `number` versus Hyprland's conflated `id`,
and `representation` versus a toplevel model. That asymmetry is worth keeping
visible, because it is the row that a future Quickshell I3/sway API could
delete outright.

---

## C. What leaves

**C1** The menu back button is offered upstream. It is +106/−1 — 44% of the
whole patch — and it is not a port: touch-or-no-hardware-keyboard detection and
a back affordance are not PinePhone-specific, and upstream's own launcher
dead-ends on a touchscreen exactly the same way. It is also the file with the
most drift to absorb (85 changed lines between the pin and `quattro`), so it is
the row that costs the most to carry and the most to rebase.
**?** — whether upstream wants it is not ours to decide, but the shape it would
take there is the shape it already has.

**C2** `notification-popups-bar-opt-out.patch` is deleted here when it lands
upstream, not merged into anything. It stays byte-identical to the sibling
project's copy meanwhile, which is what keeps one patch rather than two
drifting ones.

**C3** Nothing else leaves. The port is permanent by construction, the config
row is ours, and the hosting row exists because upstream sandboxed third-party
plugins in 4.0.3 and we are not a third party. That last one is the row to
re-read on every bump: it is a hole in someone else's security boundary, and it
is the only row where upstream changing its mind is a reason for us to change
ours rather than to rebase.

---

## D. The shim boundary

**D1** The set of upstream `bin/` scripts that need Hyprland is measured on
every bump, and the ones we do not shadow are a list with reasons, not a
remainder.
**Measured 2026-09-13:** upstream ships 444 scripts in `bin/`; 75 reference
`hyprctl`, `hyprland`, `hyprlock` or `Hyprland`; `bin/omarchy-*` shadows 16.
The other 59 ship as-is.
**Re-measured at v4.0.4, 2026-09-17:** still 444 and 75. The one script
4.0.4 changed, `omarchy-install-gaming-xbox-controllers`, is not among them.

**D2** Most of the 59 are unreachable on a phone — `omarchy-hyprland-monitor-*`
is laptop and external-display plumbing, of which this device has neither. That
is a reason, and it is not the same reason as "nobody has looked".
`omarchy-system-reboot`, `omarchy-system-sleep-lock` and `omarchy-system-wake`
are in the same 59 and are *not* unreachable.
→ The check is `docs/menu-coverage.md`'s question asked of a list rather than of
a menu: for each of the 59, is there a path from the UI to it.

**D3** A bump that adds a 76th is loud. This is the `bin/` half of A2, and it
has the same shape: a count that moves without anyone deciding it should is the
failure. **?** — a count is a weak assertion (a rename keeps it steady), but it
is cheap, and the alternative is a checked-in list of 75 names that a bump has
to be diffed against by hand.

---

## E. What must not change

The seam that is already right, stated so a refactor cannot quietly take it
away.

**E1** The theme layer stays patch-free. On Hyprland the compositor theming is
upstream's own: `config/hypr/hyprland.lua` reads the active theme and `hyprctl
reload` re-reads it on a theme change, through `omarchy-theme-set-templates`'s
*user* template directory. (Pre-Hyprland this was `default/themed/sway.conf.tpl`
theming Sway, now removed.) 22 themes, zero
upstream lines touched. This is the best mechanism in the project and everything
else in this file is an argument for being more like it.

**E2** The plugin layer keeps its narrow API. **Measured 2026-09-13:** 14 QML
and 5 JS files, 13,748 lines, calling **11 distinct `shell.*` members** across
169 sites — `appLibrary` (41), `hide` (36), `summon` (34), `isPluginOpen` (26),
`panelLoaders` (8), `serviceFor` (7), `toggle` (6), `bar` (6), `openPanelIds`
(2), `plugins` (2), `callIfLoaded` (1). A change that grows that list is a
change that makes the next bump harder, and the number is the thing to quote
when arguing about it.

**E3** That API survived the drift. **Measured 2026-09-13 against `quattro`:**
all 11 members still present; `Commons/` has an identical file set;
`Style.qml` is 515 lines in both; `PluginRegistry.qml` is 743 in both;
`Util.qml` moved 155→159. Seven of the ten patched files are untouched by 363
commits. The low-coupling bet is paying, and E2 is why.

**E4** `refactor.md` §F still applies and is still the largest slimming win
inside our own layer — four surfaces carry their own drag tracker (`control center` 62
lines of drag vocabulary, `app drawer` 48, `gestures` 32). It is not
restated here; it is not an upstream-boundary problem.

---

## Sequencing

Ordered by value over risk.

1. **§A** — six lines in `prepare()`, no behaviour, converts two silent
   failures into named ones. *Done 2026-09-13.*
2. **§D1** — a measurement, not a change. Cheap, and it sizes §D2.
3. **§B** — mechanical: split one file into five by `git diff` of the same
   tree. The result must be byte-identical to what `port-4x.patch` produces,
   which is the same test the patch itself was held to when it replaced
   `port-4x.sh`.
4. **§C1** — offered upstream; out of our hands after that.
5. **§D2** — the audit. Last, because its output is a list of reasons and
   possibly no code at all.

---

## Constraints

Not acceptance criteria — the boundaries any implementation works inside.

- **Upstream has moved.** `basecamp/omarchy` is now `omacom/omarchy`, and the
  default branch is `quattro`, not `master`. `manifest.toml:31` still names
  `basecamp` and works today by GitHub's redirect, for both the API and the
  tarball. A redirect is not a pin: the ref is what makes the build
  reproducible, and the URL is what makes it fetchable, and only one of those
  is currently under our control.
- **`quattro` is not a bump target.** v4.0.4 is the newest tag; `quattro`
  is where the next major is being built, and it is *behind* the pin by 109
  commits as well as ahead by 409 (measured 2026-09-17; 103 and 363 against
  v4.0.3 four days earlier). Everything measured against it here is a
  forecast of what a bump meets, not a bump.
- **A guard that only runs on the maintainer's machine is not a guard.** §A is
  in `prepare()` because `makepkg` runs in the container, on CI, and on a bump,
  and a `scripts/` entry point runs when someone remembers.
- **The port cannot be checked by parsing QML.** `qmllint` is not on PATH under
  its own name ([[qmllint-not-on-path]]) and an offscreen parse dies at the bar
  ([[offscreen-cannot-parse-check]]). A2 is a `grep` for that reason, and a
  `grep` is enough: the import is the thing that fails to resolve.

---

## Open questions

- **Whether `20-shell-config.patch` should be a patch at all.** It is +36/−4 of
  pure configuration — a clock format, a bar id, ten plugin ids — patched into
  upstream's default `shell.json` because `structure.md` P1 forbids writing into
  `$HOME` and there is no system-level config path to write instead. If upstream
  reads a second path (`/etc/omarchy/shell.json`, or a `.d/` directory), this
  row disappears and takes the most conflict-prone hunk with it: upstream adding
  one default plugin to that array is a reject. Worth asking upstream for
  before carrying it further.
- **Whether the hosting row survives contact with upstream's trust model.**
  `pluginIsTrusted()` trusts the `moarchy.` namespace because the scoped
  `PluginShellApi` has no `panelLoaders`, no `openPanelIds` and no
  cross-plugin summon — which is most of what `moarchy.gestures` is (E2's list
  is the evidence). If upstream's sandbox grows those capabilities for scoped
  plugins, the right move is to drop the hunk and take the sandbox, not to keep
  the hole.
- **Whether A2 should also assert the positive.** It proves no Hyprland
  reference survives; it does not prove `Quickshell.I3` arrived — a hunk that
  deleted an import without adding one would pass. The counter is that
  `Workspaces.qml` and the bar would fail at runtime immediately and the
  selftest would say so, which makes it a check with a cheaper twin already in
  place. **?**
- **Whether the 59 unshadowed scripts should be removed from the package
  rather than audited.** `omarchy-config`'s `package()` installs all 444 by
  glob. A `NoInstall` list is a second list to keep in step
  ([[empty-list-means-unreadable]] is the shape of how that goes wrong), and the
  saving is a few hundred KB of shell scripts. Probably not — but D2's output is
  what decides it.
