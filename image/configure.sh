# --- the user (I8) ---------------------------------------------------------
# DanctNIX ships `alarm` with the password 123456 and root with `root`. Neither
# is in this image. The account gets a short documented default PIN instead,
# and root stays locked:
#
#   - The session lock is a PIN pad that authenticates through PAM. It used to
#     ship a LOCKED password, which PAM can never accept, so the first
#     before-sleep lock trapped the user on the lock screen with no shell to
#     run `passwd` from (D30). A known default is the quick fix; the user
#     changes it with `passwd` (it asks for this default first).
#   - The default is public by design, so it must not open anything remote:
#     sshd is not enabled, and password authentication is off if it is enabled
#     (below). It only ever unlocks the screen of a phone you are holding.
#   - tty1 autologin is how the phone is used and does not consult a password.
#   - sudo is passwordless for this account. On a device with no disk
#     encryption that concedes nothing: anyone holding the phone can read the
#     storage. It is the same deliberate choice the dev provisioning makes.
#
# image/verify.sh accepts exactly this default (it recomputes the hash) and
# still fails on any other real password in the image. Keep the two in step.

#   error: moarchy: missing required signature
#   error: database 'moarchy' is not valid (invalid or corrupted database)
#
# Not "installs take a moment to start working". One invalid database stops the
# whole transaction, so `pacman -Sp vim` failed too, out of [extra], which has
# nothing to do with ours. Every Install and Remove row in Settings, every
# "More software" row and every font install was dead from first boot until
# somebody ran `pacman -Sy` by hand -- and nothing on screen said so, because
# the row opens a terminal that prints the error and waits (E8).
#
# Refreshing here fetches $repo.db.sig from the real server into the image, so a

# TLS handshake, and the phone can no longer install anything:
#
#   yay:    x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid
#   pacman: SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK
#
# Reported from a freshly flashed 0.1.1 card. It reads like a broken package
# repo or a release that has not been published yet, and it is neither, which
# is most of why it is worth the comment.
#
# NTP rather than a baked-in timestamp, because it corrects the clock in both
# directions: a stale RTC reads into the past, a garbage one into the future,
