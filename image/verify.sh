# Read-write on purpose: root.img is a copy carved out of the image, so the
# behavioural section below can actually run the first-boot scripts in it. The
# published .img.xz is untouched.
#
# Two ways to mount it, and which one is available is a property of the
# CONTAINER ENGINE rather than of the image.
#
# A loop mount is the better one and is tried first: it puts a real block
# device under the filesystem, which is what lets verify_grow exercise an
# ONLINE resize2fs -- the thing that actually happens on the phone.
#
# Rootless podman cannot do it. `mount -o loop` returns EPERM and
# /dev/loop-control is owned by nobody inside the user namespace, because
# setting up a loop device needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the INITIAL namespace and a
# rootless container has it only in its own. That is a real restriction, not a
# missing flag, and no amount of --privileged changes it.
#
# So fall back to fuse2fs, which implements ext4 in userspace over /dev/fuse
# and needs no block device at all. -o fakeroot makes it report the ownership
# recorded in the filesystem rather than mapping everything to the caller,
# which every `have`/ownership check below depends on.
#
# allow_other is not optional here, and the reason is easy to miss. A FUSE
# mount is PRIVATE to the user that mounted it: every other uid gets EACCES,
# including one this script switches to itself. The behavioural checks below
# run parts of the first-boot path as the phone's own user, and without
# allow_other that fails as
#
#   runuser: failed to execute env: Permission denied
#
# which reads like a broken binary or a noexec mount, and is neither -- root
# can execute the very same file. It needs `user_allow_other` in
# /etc/fuse.conf, which image/Dockerfile sets.
#
# ROOT_MOUNT_KIND is read by verify_grow, which cannot do an online grow
# through FUSE and says so rather than silently testing something weaker.
