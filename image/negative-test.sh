# Prove the verifier can fail.
#
# Every check in verify.sh passed on the first image that was built, including
# two that were passing for the wrong reason and two that were FAILING for the
# wrong reason. A suite that has only ever been run against a good image has not
# been shown to measure anything.
#
# So: take a good artifact, break specific things, and assert that verify.sh
# reports exactly those and exits non-zero.
#
# Ported from the sunxi-gpt artifact on 2026-09-19. That version broke the
# u-boot SPL magic at byte 131076 and loop-mounted the rootfs at LBA 266240 --
# both facts about a whole-disk image on removable media, and neither one
# expressible about a directory of boot.img/vbmeta.img/rootfs.simg. The planted
# defects below are the same six ideas against the shape that is left: one per
# layer verify.sh has (artifact, boot image, verified boot, rootfs contents,
# first-boot units).
#
# Disk: the rootfs is sparse, so breaking anything inside it means expanding it,
# editing it, and re-sparsing it. Peak usage is about twice the rootfs -- the
# raw copy is deleted as soon as img2simg has read it, and verify.sh then
# expands its own. [[docker-vm-disk-kills-image-build]] is what this comment is
# here to prevent a repeat of.
