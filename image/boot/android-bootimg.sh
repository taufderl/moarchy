# The Android boot backend: mkbootimg-style boot.img, AVB, fastboot.
#
# docs/devices.md D9, and D0's general case rather than the carve-out -- the
# Pixel 3a, the Fairphone 4 and 5 and every other Qualcomm handset with an
# unlockable bootloader are this shape: fastboot, an Android boot image, A/B
# slots, verified boot, non-removable storage. A second device on this backend
# should be a device package and a DTB name, not another file here.
#
# Sourced by image/build.sh, which calls the three hooks below. Produces a
# DIRECTORY rather than a single file, and D10 says that asymmetry with
# the difference is kept rather than papered over: there is no container both a `dd`
# workflow and a `fastboot flash` workflow could share that anything can read.
#
# Every offset, address and page size here was measured off a postmarketOS
# boot.img that demonstrably boots the target device (devices.md §8.1), and
# image/boot/test-android-image.py reproduces that image byte-for-byte from its
# own parts. None of it came from a wiki.

# The device-specific facts, and the whole of them -- a second Qualcomm phone
# adds a stanza here and changes nothing else in this file. It was two strings
# when sargo was the only handset; adding the Fairphone 4 took it to six, and
# every one of the four new ones is a place the two phones genuinely differ
# rather than a place the abstraction leaked.
#
#   DTB_NAME        the device tree appended to the kernel
#   ROOT_PARTLABEL  the GPT partition the rootfs is flashed to, and the name the
#                   kernel is given to find it again at boot (D24). A vendor
#                   fact: we do not choose it, we read it -- `blkid` on the
#                   handset reports PARTLABEL="userdata" for /dev/mmcblk0p72,
#                   and the Fairphone reports the same name for /dev/sda11.
#   KFLAVOR         the kernel package's flavor, which is the directory
#                   /usr/share/kernel/<flavor>/kernel.release lives in. Two
#                   phones on two SoCs cannot share one, and reading the sargo
#                   path on a Fairphone is a "no kernel.release in the rootfs"
#                   that blames a missing package.
#   ROOT_BUILTINS   the modules that MUST be built in for D24 to hold on this
#                   device. The storage driver differs per phone -- eMMC on
#                   sargo, UFS on the Fairphone -- and this is the list
#                   backend_kernel asserts against modules.builtin.
#   ERASE_DTBO      whether flash.sh clears the dtbo partition.
#   NEEDS_VBMETA    whether this bootloader takes a verification-disabling
#                   vbmeta, and therefore whether one is built at all.
#
# Resolved in a function called BY THE HOOKS, not at source time. It was a bare
# `case` with a ${DTB_NAME:?} default, which meant sourcing this file with an
# unexpected DEVICE killed the shell before a single hook was defined -- so
# build.sh's "does this backend define all three hooks?" check reported a
# backend with no hooks at all, which is a far more alarming thing than the
# wrong device name. Sourcing a backend must never have side effects; it
# defines functions and does nothing else.

#
#   root=PARTLABEL=  the GPT name, resolved by the kernel itself out of the
#                    partition table. Not LABEL=, which needs a udev that reads
#                    superblocks, which needs an initramfs (D24). ABL passes its
#                    own root=PARTUUID= for the Android system partition; this
#                    overrides it.
#   ro               so systemd-fsck-root can check the root before anything
#                    writes to it; /etc/fstab then remounts it rw. ABL sets ro
#                    too, but relying on that would be relying on a bootloader.
#   rootwait         eMMC is not necessarily probed by the time init runs.
#                    rootwait retries the WHOLE lookup, PARTLABEL included --
#                    devt_from_partlabel returns -ENODEV, not -EINVAL, so the
#                    wait is not disabled.

#                    without this the kernel tries and fails f2fs before ext4.
#                    Harmless, and unreadable on a device with no console.
#   init=/sbin/init  THE one that is not optional. ABL appends init=/init, which
#                    is right for an Android ramdisk and wrong for every rootfs
#                    we will ever ship. An Arch root has no /init, and a failed
#                    init= is a kernel panic() with no fallback to /sbin/init --
#                    so the phone mounted root correctly and died one exec

#                    registered its clock services, which on a slow boot slips
#                    past the kernel's 10 s default deferred-probe window
#                    (CONFIG_DRIVER_DEFERRED_PROBE_TIMEOUT). When it does, the
#                    pinctrl and every consumer -- both macros, both SoundWire
#                    controllers, the sound card -- give up and audio is silently
#                    gone for the whole boot, not retried (fp4-defects.md D10,
#                    ~1-in-8 boots). 60 s clears the ADSP-ready window with margin
#                    and costs nothing on a normal boot (the timeout only bites a
#                    genuinely unprobeable device). If ABL turns out to strip this
