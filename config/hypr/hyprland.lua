-- moarchy -- top-level Hyprland config.
--
-- Installed as /usr/share/moarchy/config/hypr/hyprland.lua and passed to
-- Hyprland with -c by /etc/profile.d/zz-moarchy.sh. NOT ~/.config/hypr/, which
-- is where upstream puts its own: docs/structure.md P1 forbids this package
-- putting files in $HOME, and `Hyprland -c <file>` means it does not have to.
--
-- Upstream 4.x configures Hyprland in LUA, not hyprlang, so this is a program
-- rather than a list of settings. The layering is upstream's own, with two
-- directories inserted into package.path so that `require("hypr.bindings")`
-- finds OURS -- and so a user file in ~/.config/hypr/ still wins over both.

-- Upstream's bootstrap: clears package.loaded for the reloadable prefixes
-- (default.hypr, hypr, omarchy.current.theme) so `hyprctl reload` re-reads
-- them, and sets the base package.path.

-- Insert moarchy's two layers between the user's and upstream's. The HOME
-- entries are re-stated in front deliberately: a duplicate package.path entry
-- never matches twice, and this way the whole search order is one readable
-- list rather than a gsub into somebody else's string.

--   ~/.config        the user's own overrides, which win over everything

-- PATH, and this is load-bearing rather than tidy.
--
-- upstream's default/hypr/envs.lua ends with hl.env("PATH", ...) putting
-- $OMARCHY_PATH/bin FIRST -- it rebuilds the variable rather than appending,
-- and its own comment says why: `hyprctl setenv` does not reach the keybind
-- dispatcher's environment, so the compositor has to own PATH.
--
-- The login shell already put /usr/lib/moarchy/bin first (zz-moarchy.sh), but
-- that ordering does not survive the line above: every binding would resolve
-- omarchy-menu, omarchy-system-lock and the rest to UPSTREAM's copy rather
-- than to the ones this project shadows them with. Nothing would error; the
-- phone would just quietly run the desktop's scripts.
